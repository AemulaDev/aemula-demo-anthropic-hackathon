Learn about our approach to collective intelligence and managing the complexity of technological change* *[here](https://tamingcomplexity.substack.com/about).*\n\n***\n\nAs a Zen monk, I participated in the events of January 6th 2021. Or perhaps I should say, they participated in me. Either way, it’s a day I will never forget. Not because I was anywhere near Washington DC. I was on the other side of the world, in a remote Zen monastery on the west coast of Japan.\n\nAcross the Pacific, it was already January 7th when the news broke. That morning, I was on cook duty at Daieiji, a Zen monastery in Niigata. I had done about six months of training there a couple years prior, and since I already knew my way around the kitchen, I was quickly cycled back into the rotation. Half or more of the other monks in training were younger guys who’d never really cooked anything besides “Cup Noodles” in their life.\n\nRising at 4 AM, a precious 20 minutes before everyone else, I made my way to the _bonsho,_ the big outdoor bell, and, shivering against the bitter pre-dawn cold, climbed the bell tower ladder. I performed three prostrations. Then rang the bell. Then another three prostrations. Then bell. And so on, until 4:45. Finished, and wide awake, I came down to the kitchen to get the rice porridge going. As usual.\n\nBut today was different: I had a phone in my pocket. And in previous years, a few clever brothers had surreptitiously installed WIFI one day while the Abbot was out. And I knew the password. I was going to get online for the first time in months.\n\nTruth is, new recruits aren’t allowed to bring anything up to the monastery except their bedding, robes, and sutra books. And, once in, they aren’t allowed to leave the premises or receive visitors for 100 days. Phones, however, are not welcome in the monastery, at any stage.\n\nTechnically, though, I wasn’t a new recruit. I had simply returned from a 2 year leave of absence. At least, that’s how I justified it to myself. So, on a rare day of rest following the New Year holidays, I asked my wife, who is Japanese, to drop by with my iPhone. I felt compelled to check in on my home country, America—and was willing to break my “digital detox” to do so.\n\nFondling the forbidden phone, hidden away in a fold of my robes, I awaited the moment when everyone—the Abbot, his attendant for the day, and the rest of the trainees—would be busy chanting the morning services.\n\nAs the time approached, imagining what might be going on back home, I phrase from the sci-fi protagonists of old floated through my mind: “I gotta bad feeling about this.”\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!niFS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7273df-b2e9-4498-9b9e-36ceb40cb67f_498x218.heic)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!niFS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7273df-b2e9-4498-9b9e-36ceb40cb67f_498x218.heic)\n\nMy wife and I left the States just a month before the November 2020 election. If you were there, you probably remember: the country was a confused mess. Mask mandates were in effect and everything was still mostly shut down, including Stanford University where I had a research position. We were still wiping down groceries. Hate crimes against Asians were on the rise, even in my hometown of Bloomington, IN. And worse, it looked like Trump would be re-elected. America, it seemed, hadn’t learned anything after a 4-year dalliance with unhinged authoritarianism.\n\nAnd I had taken Buddhist vows not quite ten years earlier. Seeing the world come to a crashing halt as people died in droves felt like impermanence smacking me in the face. Suddenly, the teachings of the Buddha, which transcend life and death, seemed more relevant than anything I was reading as an academic. The Universe was giving me a sign about what I should do with this one life I have to live.\n\nAt the time, I was collaborating on a paper that proposed seeing the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity, an opening to _something else_; as a [“Portal to Alternative Futures in the Making.”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1089/omi.2020.0089) I decided to take that proposition seriously. After seven years in upstate NY and almost a year in Palo Alto, my wife and I sized up our options, and agreed the writing was on the wall: It was time for us to go.\n\nTo go back to Japan—where they wear masks as a courtesy to others.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3K65!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6c34e1-4850-4f3d-af3a-2dbb2ab86ca8_1280x960.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3K65!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6c34e1-4850-4f3d-af3a-2dbb2ab86ca8_1280x960.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The author and wife fresh from 2 weeks of isolation in Tokyo, October 2020.}}\n\nAlmost a decade prior, we’d met and married in Japan. So I was permitted into the country on a spousal visa, expressly on the condition that we were not traveling, but moving back, permanently. We flew during peak COVID, when you still had to get tested—that awful nasal swab that leaves you wondering whether they aren’t scraping your prefrontal cortex with that deluxe Q-tip—within 72 hours of your flight.\n\nUnlike the barebones chaos of American airports, with overworked skeleton crews in poorly-fitting paper masks shouting over confused crowds, our arrival at Tokyo’s Narita was calming, and surreal. Filing down the long hallway into a wide open room, we were greeted by dozens of staff in white, full-body hazmat suits, who kindly asked us to spit into tiny test tubes. No brutal nasal swabs here.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!O5Ib!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39004f03-d92c-4401-a423-05d568b8e036_1920x1080.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!O5Ib!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39004f03-d92c-4401-a423-05d568b8e036_1920x1080.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The author entering the Zen monastery, Daieiji, for the first time, in 2018.}}\n\nI re-entered the monastery a few days after the 2020 election. It was joyous. In the time I was gone, my direct \\_senpai—\\_the monk one step above me in the rigid monastic hierarchy—had risen to head monk. The new guys had heard all about me. Everyone was happy to have the foreigner back on the team.\n\nNever having really played or enjoyed team sports, that is still the best I can analogize monastic life to: being on a team—only the game is never over, and you don’t go home. You do everything—wake, meditate, pray, eat, work, bathe, and sleep (what little you can get)—together. It might sound claustrophobic, and it is at times, but it was an utter relief to be away from America’s mess.\n\nOut in rural Japan, COVID, too, seemed distant. Within the monastery, life proceeded pretty much as it always had. We monks stayed busy: meditating for a week in early December, gathering donations of vegetables to store for winter—burying offerings of cabbages and _daikon_ radishes in the sandy loam out back—and prepping for the New Year’s holidays.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wjwe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8f65c89-e2e6-4e51-9159-64c90d966cbd_4032x3024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wjwe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8f65c89-e2e6-4e51-9159-64c90d966cbd_4032x3024.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Pounding rice into mochi in preparation for the New Year with the brothers.}}\n\nOn January 1st, 2021, while cleaning up my section of the common area, I discovered my old keychain. It was empty. I had given up my world. No car, no home, nothing to call “mine” and lock up. At 36 years old, I was a homeless Zen monk.\n\nAnd yet, I found myself unable to rally the triumphant attitude of worldly renunciation that one reads of in the annals of the masters. Here I was, doing the kind of deep dopamine detox that Silicon Valley tech bros can only dream of—but I had to admit: I couldn’t shake my concern for my country, my family, and friends.\n\nThe first pangs of a feeling I can only describe as “survivor’s guilt” set in. I had escaped the madness, and found myself in a place that afforded a life that, while not easy, was safe, and more importantly, sane. In doing so, however, I left everything behind in the sinking ship of the United States.\n\nAnd I had a bad feeling about that.\n\nIt drove me to justify something I would have never otherwise done: Sneak a smartphone into a Zen monastery. For compassion’s sake, right?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1IsV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F587ec509-0828-43cb-80eb-611a475df421_1200x800.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1IsV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F587ec509-0828-43cb-80eb-611a475df421_1200x800.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The author, on winter begging rounds.}}\n\nFinally, my moment came. I heard the _ino,_ the ceremony leader, intone the first syllables of the Heart Sutra and calculated that I had about 10 minutes before the Abbot’s attendant for the day would come pick up a pot of hot water for his quarters. Trundling out my iPhone Mini, I clicked open the _NYT_ to behold the stunning headline: “TRUMP INCITES MOB”!\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aavI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85ddb51d-25a3-4015-908e-06fff2b9c8e9_2296x1802.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aavI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85ddb51d-25a3-4015-908e-06fff2b9c8e9_2296x1802.png)\n\nWell holy shit. It was just a few pixels of black on a tiny screen of white, but the assembled combination of letters sent my head reeling. A stunned disbelief at what was there before my very eyes, offset by the sudden confirmation of all my suspicions. _I knew it!_ At last, the “bad feeling” I had been harboring was borne out as an accurate intuition. _I knew it!_ Things _were_ going to shit\\_.\\_ And that lingering fear—that maybe I had misread things, overreacted, fled prematurely—vanished.\n\nIn a daze, I scrolled through the scenes of rioters fighting police before the sounds of the attendant shuffling down the hallway brought me back: back from the fractured instantaneity of social media; back from a polarized America’s fragmenting culture; and back to my safe, sane, tidy life in the cold kitchen of the monastery.\n\nI still had porridge to make.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4x22!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11dfd39a-ad4f-4d9b-bf12-f3594b491d05_3585x3024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4x22!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11dfd39a-ad4f-4d9b-bf12-f3594b491d05_3585x3024.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The view from the Buddha Hall, January 2021.}}\n\nThroughout the day, mostly alone in the kitchen, I chewed on my secret knowledge, turning it over in my mind as I salted radishes for pickling.\n\nTelling anyone was out of the question; the phone had to remain a secret. Besides, in a monastery, discussions of politics are reserved for the Abbott. Lowly monks in training, by contrast, are actively, often loudly, encouraged by their _senpai_ to take their precious opinion and go shut the fuck up about it.\n\nOn duty until 7 PM, when tomorrow’s cook would show up for a hand-off, my Cartesian theater was booked solid with a private showing of “Chicken Little.” The sky _was_ falling, but I was the only one who knew anything about it.\n\nIn the weeks after Biden was finally inaugurated, it looked to many like life would return to a pre-Trump status quo. I still had bad feelings about it all, though.\n\n## Bad feelings\n\nTo begin, unlike so many Americans, I wasn’t horrified at the scenes of belligerent “patriots” defying police and defiling the halls of power. I had already turned my back on the mundane world—what did I care about disruptions to Washington’s pomp and circumstance? To be sure, the loss of life was lamentable. But the righteous destruction of hollow decorum in the name of a higher purpose? I could actually sympathize with that, having imagined myself to have done something similar when I walked away from Stanford and the academic path.\n\nIndeed, what I felt was _jealousy_.\n\nDuring morning mediations, one thought kept rattling round and round my head: “That should have been us!”\n\nThat should have been us, putting a stop to illegitimate politics and politicians! That should have been us, reclaiming the People’s House! _That should be us right now!_ We, the defenders of democracy, should be up there—not fighting for a cretinous would-be King—but to expand the Power of the People! Fighting for our political autonomy! Defending our noble heritage of self-rule!\n\nIt wasn’t long before my jealousy morphed into _anger_. Not that it happened, but who did it—and what they didn’t do. I was furious that it was Hillary’s “basket of deplorables,” of all people, who had actually succeeded in striking at the throbbing heart of American politics. Not because I disagreed with their cultural views—though I did—but because these self-proclaimed patriots had somehow achieved what no progressive movement ever has: they breached the inner sanctum of American democracy. Then once inside, they squandered their precious chance.\n\nReal revolutionaries would have seized the moment. These goons were there to “Stop the Steal”—but once it was stopped, most of them just stumbled around the place, gawking, stealing, pooping on stuff and posting on social media. Factions within the mob made futile efforts to chase down specific politicians, such as Mike Pence, but the mass of J6ers, with no real political vision beyond grievance, had no plans to execute.\n\nThen, of course, my anger threatened to turn inward. Now the thought plaguing me during morning meditations was a question: “Well what would you have done instead?”\n\n## If it had been us\n\nInstead of MAGA hats and Confederate flags, imagine it had been those who actually lost the most under minority rule. The teachers whose unions were busted. Voters from districts gerrymandered into irrelevance. The victims of opiates, whose lives have been ruined by Big Pharma and its press-gang of doctors. Workers of all stripes, whose wages have stagnated for fifty years while productivity soared and wealth concentrated upward. And sure, even kids—the very kids who will inherit an unlivable hellscape of a planet because the oil companies own Washington.\n\nImagine they breached the Capitol not to stop a legitimate vote count, but to demand the system actually count their votes equally. Not to re-install a strongman, but to stop the structures that make strongmen possible. Livid at the systematic closure of the extant channels of democratic change, and furious with a congress that made itself the prison of popular will, these revolutionaries would strike at the architecture of minority rule itself:\n\n* Stop the Steal!? How about “Stop the Senate!” Abolish that obsolete body! At least end the two-per-state rule, which turns the happenstance of geography into de-facto aristocracy, and institute proportional representation! Or at the very least, put age- and term-limits on those fossils.\n\n* Stop the Supreme Court! Abolish that cabal of lawyers with their lifetime appointments! Let us lay low those proven liars, who promised to defend the constitution, but instead ply their doctrine of “Originalism” to pay obeisance to a tyrant! Can we really go on letting nine unelected elites override 330 million people indefinitely?\n\n* Stop the state-based national election system! Abolish the Electoral College! That anti-democratic relic was designed to accommodate slaveholders in the 18th-century and thwart the majority will. How long can we pretend that presidents who lose the popular vote are “democratically elected” leaders?\n\n* Stop _Citizens United_! Abolish the legalized theft of elections by the propertied classes—everywhere in America! Money is not speech, and corporations are not people: This is legalized oligarchy wearing the mask of the First Amendment.\n\n* Stop voting altogether and institute sortition! Instead of voters choosing politicians, we have politicians gerrymandering to choose their voters. Who still has faith in the two-party duopoly? The only way we can ensure proportional representation is random assignment—the Greeks knew this!\n\n* Stop the Steal!? _Stop sacrificing our sovereignty to self-interested strongmen!_\n\nMy imaginary revolutionaries would come ready with demands about _who gets to decide_—and plans for radically restructuring the decision making process. The J6ers just wanted to keep their King—but us? We want a democracy of, by, and for the people. They had no real plans for taking power, because they were acting under someone else’s power. We, on the other hand, would take power from the elites only to distribute it more democratically.\n\n## Where are we now?\n\nSoon, the event and its aftermath was stealing my attention, and my ability to stop worrying about the mundane world. I started sneaking the phone around with me everywhere, constantly checking the news in the few places I had privacy: on the toilet, early mornings in the kitchen, and under the covers before bed.\n\nJanuary 6th was the day the algorithm got me into its clutches. Somewhere, a world away, Steve Bannon belched a few foul chuckles. My zone had been flooded.\n\nIn the years that followed, I graduated from the monastery, received transmission of the Dharma, moved into [“my own” temple](https://keigakuji.org), became the abbot. I wish I could tell you that I was cool, confident, and unconcerned by worldly matters throughout all of that. But the algorithmic Skinner box still had me trapped. And like a pigeon on an intermittent reward schedule, I am ashamed to say, I kept coming back for more news from home, lest I miss another coup attempt.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ihzQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c14ba8a-420c-4669-b251-e650e9af9b49_2316x2512.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ihzQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c14ba8a-420c-4669-b251-e650e9af9b49_2316x2512.jpeg)\n\nIt might just be the electronic fangs of the algorithm preying on my psychology through its many “feeds,” but in the years since J6, my anger has turned to fear.\n\nFear that there is no “us.” A fear that “my side” doesn’t actually believe in American democracy. Not as practiced, anyway. We’ve spent decades pointing out that the franchise is a rich man’s game, that the Founders were slaveholders, that the Constitution was con-job designed to constrain majorities, and that capitalism corrupts everything it touches—especially government. We’ve taught ourselves that democracy never really existed in America, that it’s always been a sham.\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that when what might become the last presidential election to take place in our Great Nation rolled around and the Democrats called on us to “save democracy,” a great many of us couldn’t be bothered. What is there to save?\n\nNow, as it faces destruction at the hands of a rampaging Tyrant, all too many of us are falling back on the very mechanisms of democratic governance we had poo-pooed for so long: hoping military leaders won’t follow illegal orders; counting on the courts to save us; and just waiting until the midterms.\n\nThis is weak tea for potent political times.\n\nToday we confront a stark possibility: Two and a half centuries into this beautiful experiment, a new democratic revolution may be necessary to remove a tyrant from our midst, once again. Is our side up to the task? Do we have a vision beyond mere grievance?\n\nThe enemies of democracy already drape themselves in the flag and parade as true patriots. They have already claimed 1776, and the Founders. They claim to revere the Constitution as secular holy writ, and deploy it as selectively as the Bible. And, as January 6th showed, they can weaponize this mythology of America to great effect.\n\nWhat do we have? The New Deal? The Civil Rights Movement? Though important, these are mere reforms, not revolutionary origin myths we can call upon. The white, Christian America they conjure may have never existed, but it motivates them. Meanwhile, we have let anti-whiteness discourse poison the well of our nation’s history, dispelling any possibility of drawing inspiration from it. As [Catherine Liu points out](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517912253/virtue-hoarders/), the [1619 Project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html) and other attempts to reframe the founding solely around slavery ultimately serve the MAGA cause by foreclosing the possibility of interethnic solidarity around shared goals—namely, broader, more inclusive forms of democracy.\n\nWhen asked who George Washington was, how many of us will respond with contempt “slave owner” rather than “OG revolutionary”? Both are true. But only the latter gives us something to build on.\n\nYes, the Founders were flawed men, with questionable goals. Yes, the franchise of American democracy was only gradually and grudgingly expanded, and still remains imperfect today. None of this invalidates the democratic _horizon_ this nation was founded on. True democracy has never existed anywhere, because it is not a black-and-white state of affairs—it is an aspiration, a practice, and a path to tread.\n\nBut clever postmodernists have deconstructed the American experiment so thoroughly that we no longer know how to put one foot in front of the other. While the J6ers were storming the Capitol, we were debating whether the building deserved to stand.\n\nJanuary 6th was a portal into this hellish timeline. With the 2026 mid-terms looming, another one is due to open up.\n\nWhen it does, on the 250th anniversary of the founding of our Great Nation, who among us will be willing to walk the path of democracy?\n\n***\n\n*This article reproduces content from Taming Complexity, a Substack from a group of political analysts exploring why organizations and societies make bad decisions about science and technology, and how they could make better ones.*\n\n*Taming Complexity is written by Taylor Dotson, Michael Bouchey, and Shunryu Garvey.
