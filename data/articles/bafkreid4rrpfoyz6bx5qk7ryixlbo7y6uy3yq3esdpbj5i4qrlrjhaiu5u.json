A packed planning meeting about new power lines drew parents in jeans, an engineer in a neon vest, and a retired systems analyst who shook his head as he stepped to the mic. “We don’t want to pay for something that’s going to go somewhere else,” said Jatinder Chandok, pointing at a map of data-center sprawl and the proposed high-voltage lines to feed it. The applause was instinctive, the fear familiar: big tech moves in, the bills go up, and ordinary households foot the tab.\n\nThe newest analysis from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, working with the Brattle Group, complicates that story. Across states from 2019–2024, when total electricity use grew, average prices often didn’t. The researchers estimate that a 10 percent increase in statewide load reduced average prices by about 0.6¢/kWh, largely because fixed grid costs were spread over more kilowatt-hours (for scale: average U.S. residential price is \\~13¢/kWh). In a business where poles and wires dominate the bill, selling more units can make the units cheaper.¹\n\nNorth Dakota is the cleanest example. Load rose roughly 40% over the period—data centers among the drivers—yet inflation-adjusted prices fell by about 3¢/kWh. Commercial and industrial rates declined; residential prices were flat in nominal dollars and down after inflation, cushioned by local wind, coal, and cheap gas.¹ ¹² Virginia sits on the tightrope. Statewide, demand climbed about 14% and average prices dipped \\~1¢/kWh—but inside Dominion’s territory, residential prices were up roughly 3¢/kWh in nominal terms and only slightly down after inflation because rapid load growth offset part of the rise. Regulators are already bracing for the next chapter: Dominion has proposed base-rate increases and a separate rate class for data centers to reflect rising costs for capacity, labor, equipment, and grid upgrades.¹² ⁶\n\nMore load can lower average prices—until it can’t.\n\nCalifornia shows the other side of the ledger. Overall demand slipped a bit even as prices jumped. Wildfire liability and mitigation programs, plus heavy distribution spending, pounded bills; Lawrence Berkeley’s case study traces about 40% of the five-year increase to wildfire-related costs—insurance, hardening, and the price of failure.² Pull back and the national pattern snaps into focus. Generation costs, on average, have drifted down, while “delivery”—especially distribution—has marched upward; for investor-owned utilities, inflation-adjusted distribution CapEx rose \\~35% from 2019–2024.¹\n\nThen the hardware crunch hit. Distribution and large power transformers became the chokepoint throttling electrification—prices up \\~60–80% since 2020, with lead times stretching from about a year to several in the hardest-hit regions.³ Disasters compound it. Florida’s storm run pushed hardening and restoration riders onto bills; in Houston, repairs after Hurricane Beryl (July 2024) sparked bruising fights over cost recovery and securitization as residents told commissioners about spoiled groceries, medical-equipment worries, and week-long outages.⁴ In other words, the bill most families see is increasingly the cost of street-level infrastructure and the risks around it—not a simple tally of electrons.\n\nWholesale markets add their own weather vane. When supply tightens, prices remind everyone who’s boss. PJM’s 2025/26 capacity auction cleared high across constrained zones, a warning shot for retail rates in places where load growth outruns new steel in the ground.⁵\n\nCloser to New England’s kitchen tables, the drivers are now printed right on the bill. In New Hampshire, consumer advocate Don Kreis warned that lifting fixed customer charges—nearly $20 today with escalators aimed much higher—“hits harder for people who can least afford it,” a shift the commission agreed to reconsider after a public backlash.¹³ In Maine, the Office of the Public Advocate itemized storm-recovery costs that now show up as both a flat and per-kWh rider—evidence that the most reliable way to shrink bills is to need fewer repairs, not fewer headlines.¹⁴\n\nSo is it true that data centers aren’t causing price spikes? The honest answer is it depends. Where utilities plan ahead, properly assign upgrade costs, and make big loads flexible, growth can hold prices steady—or even lower them—by spreading fixed costs and keeping capacity markets calm.¹ ¹² Where capacity, wires, and weather run hot, new mega-loads can lift bills unless they bring their own supply, their own flexibility, or direct payments for the upgrades they trigger. That’s not a culture-war verdict; it’s an engineering and accounting one. Blame is a blunt tool; planning is a scalpel.\n\nThe reform path runs through three wires: pricing, efficiency, and flexibility. Start by pricing upgrades where they happen. Virginia’s nonpartisan JLARC panel lays out a toolkit: directly assign grid upgrades that primarily serve hyperscale campuses; create dedicated rate classes; require minimum bills tied to contracted demand; and steer siting toward headroom that already exists.⁶\n\nNext, wring more out of the wires we already have. Grid-enhancing technologies—dynamic line ratings that reflect real weather, topology optimization, and modern power-flow controllers—unlock headroom quickly and cheaply; FERC Order 881 requires ambient-adjusted ratings nationwide by July 2025, with more dynamic approaches under active consideration.⁷\n\nThen make big loads flexible on purpose. Google’s new agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and TVA commit data centers to shift AI workloads at peak, effectively turning server halls into dispatchable demand-response resources instead of pure liabilities.⁸\n\nStop paying more than we need to for capacity that can be deferred. New York’s Brooklyn-Queens Demand Management program avoided a $1.2 billion substation by contracting targeted efficiency, demand response, and distributed resources where the feeder was actually constrained—a template that now exists precisely so regulators can buy the cheapest reliability, not just the largest asset.⁹\n\nFix the incentives that keep pushing utilities toward concrete over code. Hawai‘i’s performance-based regulation lets utilities earn for outcomes—affordability, reliability, interconnection speed—rather than only for capital deployed, chipping away at the old bias that makes every problem look like a substation.¹⁰ And be honest about risk. In high-fire or high-wind corridors, targeted undergrounding and sectionalizing can be cheaper than a decade of emergency restorations and ballooning insurance pools; California’s proceedings now spell out just how much of the bill is wildfire-driven and where surgical hardening beats blanket burial.¹¹ ²\n\nBack in the Loudoun gym, the maps came down and the meeting adjourned. Outside, the substation hummed beneath a haze of cicadas. The truth is less satisfying than a villain, but more useful for a fix: data centers are neither automatic scapegoats nor innocent bystanders. The wires are where the money is. The policy should follow. In New England cafés and Virginia gymnasiums alike, the arithmetic is the same: spread fixed costs wisely, buy flexibility before concrete, and point the next dollar at the mile of line most likely to fail. Do that, and the headline everyone wants—lower, steadier bills—will finally read like common sense rather than wishful thinking.\n\nBlame travels faster than electrons; reform should travel faster than blame.\n\n—\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
