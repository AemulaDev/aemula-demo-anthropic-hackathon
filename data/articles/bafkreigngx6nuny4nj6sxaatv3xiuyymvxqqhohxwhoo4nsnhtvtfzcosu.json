  "body": "Parts I and II can be found [here](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/p/why-why-liberalism-failed-fails-part?r=1l2z5n) and [here](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/p/why-why-liberalism-failed-fails-part-788?r=1l2z5n).\n\nPart II argued that Patrick Deneen’s low view of human nature finds little support in 2,500 years of Western theological and philosophical thought. Deneen’s view that humans are innately unequipped for freedom and responsibility certainly contradicts the thinkers of the English and Scottish Enlightenments, but it also contradicts the Protestant Reformation that preceded it and the Thomist and Augustinian approaches to human nature before that. Deneen’s pessimism puts him at odds with the major thinkers of the Western canon.\n\nThat said, it could be the case that these major thinkers are wrong. Maybe Deneen is right. Maybe human nature is such that we are genuinely unable to form meaningful communities in a liberal framework.\n\nMy third critique deals with this response directly and looks at real-world evidence of American communitarianism throughout its history.\n\nThis final critique will ask the simple question: If liberalism inevitably leads to atomization and decadence, why did the most communitarian, civically engaged period in American history occur when American liberalism was at its peak? The answer, I believe, is obvious – liberalism and community are not mutually exclusive, so Deneen’s critiques are divorced from not only theological and philosophical realities (Part II), but from historical reality as well.\n\n## **The Early Strength of American Community**\n\nAmerican “rugged individualism” is famous the world over, but, contrary to popular belief, American individualism has never enjoyed a monopoly on the American psyche. American communitarianism has ebbed and flowed throughout American history, and I believe this fact is the clearest argument yet that Deneen’s laments are nothing but intuitive appeals to nostalgia rather than anything rooted in theology, philosophy, or history.\n\nIf Deneen’s inevitably thesis is correct, we would expect American society to move inexorably towards atomized individualism over time. Instead, we see American society oscillating between individualist and communal values at different times and at different places throughout its history.\n\nIn Part I, I outlined how the founders’ [conception of liberty](https://open.substack.com/pub/travismonteleone/p/will-the-real-liberalism-please-stand?r=1l2z5n\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=false) [was split](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/liberalism-is-not-enough) – on the one hand the Lockean appeals to natural rights and consent of the governed were undoubtedly major influences on the founders, but on the other hand, a much older [Aristotelian](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/aristotle-and-locke-in-the-american-founding/) form of liberalism that focused on the cultivation of virtuous citizens in support of the _polis_ had arguably [just as large of an impact](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/recovering-the-republican-sensibility) on the founders.\n\nThis Aristotelian approach to liberty is grounded in community and [republicanism](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/recovering-the-republican-sensibility). It is focused on the common good rather than the individual, and it directly inspired the small-scale Puritan communities in New England that Alexis de Tocqueville [praised](https://thegreatthinkers.org/tocqueville/introduction/) in his landmark _Democracy in America._\n\nOther immigrant groups, such as the Quakers, Germans, Amish, Italians, and Irish, likewise formed strong communities across the country to better navigate the difficulties of assimilating in a new country. Deneen himself praises the strong communities of the Amish without considering the reason they and so many others needed to immigrate to the liberal framework offered by the American colonies in the first place.\n\nWhile American individualism is a unique, powerful, and largely beneficial force, it has never been exclusive. Instead, communalism enjoyed strong philosophical support throughout the early Republic, and the balance between individualistic and communal values has ebbed and flowed as the priorities of different groups have shifted over time.\n\n## **Bowling Alone**\n\nHow has that early emphasis on community-building changed over the course of American history? Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam’s most famous work, _[Bowling Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-D-Putnam-Bowling-Alone/dp/B00328WOQK/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9yt5S94YEjhu2qw2Yelva0aXFJdJxpNcFqz1VLVdkE2oTdG8m3hgwaWu7z3f3SeyHqS3WLH9V3KH7Azf2Dr3FTD8747-7lx_D8keBBZs0aMpuVLEtLIaJORtT9nv_v0EjVXaax1gyoCIKYRRK96zPYhOgEMsmfVyHkqCvwoecvTftC3wVa4N61pdQxQEHQIMRsYoEPSBj0o2W_4KCDRyAhM6OXq8-2g0i_rX_TZ5oWE.KBZkJR7iFqzqd-D3FnGMyo8mrUlewrcirlaSZvbRT6U\\&dib_tag=se\\&hvadid=777060907814\\&hvdev=c\\&hvexpln=0\\&hvlocphy=9192813\\&hvnetw=g\\&hvocijid=12615844904443729948--\\&hvqmt=e\\&hvrand=12615844904443729948\\&hvtargid=kwd-131483722\\&hydadcr=9332_13873925\\&keywords=bowling+alone\\&mcid=362c6684cb82355992730d1320a96b20\\&qid=1762142024\\&sr=8-3)_ (2000), seeks to answer that exact question.\n\nPutnam’s book provides incredible quantitative detail for many of the social issues that Deneen identifies in _Why Liberalism Failed_ – declining civic participation, a reduced role for religion in public life, and the rise of rampant individualism – all of which have occurred somewhat consistently from roughly 1965 to the present. In short, the book traces the decline of [social capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital) in the US over the past several decades.\n\nThe graphs below are representative of the many, many graphs Putnam uses throughout the book to make his point.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7q6o!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb99a63b-6841-415c-8cac-0fd866760f97_511x361.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7q6o!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb99a63b-6841-415c-8cac-0fd866760f97_511x361.png)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x-ux!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8609f0a1-e345-4de6-9200-2f8c2b5158b7_513x346.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x-ux!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8609f0a1-e345-4de6-9200-2f8c2b5158b7_513x346.png)\n\nThis narrative of pervasive community decline has become popular in the public imagination, and by itself, _Bowling Alone_ provides a lot of empirical support for Deneen’s claims that he himself fails to provide in _Why Liberalism Failed_. Community life has undoubtedly suffered in America since 1965.\n\n## **The Upswing**\n\nThat said, Putnam’s less well-known follow up, _[The Upswing](https://www.amazon.com/Upswing-America-Together-Century-Again/dp/198212914X)_ (2020), extends his analysis back further and puts this recent decline into context. In this work, the picture begins in the late 19th century. The same measures of social, economic, and cultural cohesiveness are looked at again.\n\nThis time, the trend is reversed. Each of the relevant measures start “low” or more individualistic during the hyper-individualist Gilded Age. Then the measures move rapidly towards a more communal ethos during the Progressive Era, World War II, and the Post-War years, before going into decline again during the _Bowling Alone_ years.\n\nLike _Bowling Alone_, Putnam again measures proxies for social capital such as organizational involvement, church attendance, and wealth inequality in order to produce the aggregated trends shown below. The y-axis can be thought of as more individualistic at the bottom and more communal at the top.\n\n[![The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It  Again by Robert D. Putnam | Goodreads](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Y0nl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5d93412-df28-49db-89d5-cadad4de7554_624x423.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Y0nl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5d93412-df28-49db-89d5-cadad4de7554_624x423.jpeg)\n\nIn a pattern that is both incredibly stark and consistent, the declining social capital metrics that Deneen laments actually peaked in the mid-20th century after a rapid ascent. This curve, which Putnam calls the “I-we-I” curve, highlights the empirical ebb and flow between individualism and communalism throughout the last 125 years of American history.\n\nThroughout the period from 1900 to 1965, or “the Upswing”, both Republican and Democratic administrations presided over large and sustained increases in civic participation, religiosity, depolarization, and social cohesion. In short, this was a sustained period of incredible social capital formation.\n\nDuring the Upswing, American liberalism was over 200 years old. So the obvious question is, why would the supposedly inevitable corrosiveness of liberalism allow for such a large increase in social cohesion fully 200 years into its history, only then to give way to the problems Deneen identifies? Deneen does not provide an answer.\n\nDeneen laments the graphs in _Bowling Alone_ without seeming to be aware of the graphs in _The Upswing_. American social capital, community life, and civic participation were not the inheritance of some pre-liberal hierarchical Thomistic worldview that was slowly fettered away.\n\nInstead, the high-water mark of American social capital was the result of conscious and intentional community-building over the course of decades within a staunchly liberal society. Liberalism, when supported by strong mediating institutions like churches and civic organizations, is compatible with and even conducive to community.\n\n## **Can The Upswing be Replicated?**\n\n_The Upswing_ is a much more optimistic book than _Bowling Alone_. Putnam spends much of the former analyzing _why_ the early 20th century provided such fertile ground for social capital formation and then looks at how we might be able to reproduce those conditions today.\n\nTo begin with, it’s important to understand exactly when the catalyst for new communities began. There’s a common misconception that the apex of social capital in the 50’s and 60’s was just a result of the trauma of the Great Depression and World War II and the forced “togetherness” that those calamities caused.\n\nThe idea that mid-century communalism was caused primarily by exogenous shocks to the system is popular, but ultimately wrong. While these two events certainly helped sustain higher levels of social capital, Putnam goes to great lengths to show that the Upswing really got its start in the period from 1900 – 1920, prior to both the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nSo what caused the Upswing at the turn of the 20th century?\n\nMost importantly, new communities were in high demand. Following the industrialization and rapid urbanization of the late 19th century, many Americans found themselves in new places with new jobs and a lack of traditional community. Individualism was also in vogue. Following the publication of _[On the Origin of Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species)_ in 1859, social Darwinian [intellectuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) argued throughout the late 19th century that “only the strong should survive”, and, as Putnam notes, the resulting social Darwinian impact on the nation’s elevation of individualism was comprehensive.\n\nIndividualism was on the rise intellectually, and dislocation and the breakdown of community were gathering pace due to technological and demographic shifts. For many, it felt like age-old bonds of community were fraying and that rampant individualism would spell [the death of the American republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Law_of_Civilization_and_Decay). Sound familiar?\n\nThere were [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) during this period who, like Deneen, argued that liberalism had failed due to its over-emphasis on the individual. Ultimately, however, it was reformers within liberalism who proved that short term dislocation and loss of community can be rectified by a committed effort to build social capital. Rather than argue that liberalism had failed, everyday citizens across the country worked from within liberalism to create a solution.\n\nThe Progressive Era of the early 20th century kickstarted a 60-year meteoric rise in community building that peaked in the mid-60s. These communities were not left or right-coded but instead consisted of Americans from across the aisle coming together to build largely apolitical communities centered around faith, civic engagement, professional organizations, and charity. The strength of these communities generated the strong social fabric that is associated with the mid-20th-century – high trust, depolarized, and civically engaged.\n\nThese Americans correctly realized that community and liberalism are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a liberal society without strong communities has clearly missed the mark. Liberalism doesn’t preclude community; it just allows separate spheres of communities to exist independently. If strong communities don’t exist within liberalism, then something has gone wrong, not with liberalism, but with the community-builders.\n\nConsider just a few highlights of American community involvement during the mid-20th-century:\n\n* **Church attendance:** In 1960, 73% of Americans were members of a church (as late as 1999, this figure was still 70%) vs today that figure [has dropped](https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx) to 47%\n\n* **Marriage rate:** Until 1910, \\~65% of the population was married. In 1960 that number increased to almost 80%, before [declining](https://usafacts.org/articles/state-relationships-marriages-and-living-alone-us/) to 47% in 2024\n\n* **Political tribalism:** In 1900, [less than 5%](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/publications/unstable-majorities-polarization-party-sorting-and-political-stalemate) of house districts had a split House/President vote. In 1980, this figure was almost 35%, before dropping to below 10% again in 2018\n\n* **Civic engagement:** In 1975-1976, 64% of all Americans attended at least one club meeting in the previous year. By 2005 that figure [had fallen](http://bowlingalone.com/?page_id=7) to 33%\n\nThese examples and countless others in the book show that there’s nothing inherent within liberalism that precludes the creation of strong communities. Social capital formation has ebbed and flowed throughout American history, and when faced with extreme challenges in the past, American liberalism has been able to rise to the challenge.\n\nLiberalism allows us the freedom to build communities, doing so just requires concerted effort and will. If the very social cohesion that Deneen laments was consciously created within liberalism, then there’s no reason it can’t be created again.\n\n## **Why ‘Why Liberalism Failed’ Succeeded**\n\nI’ve now argued extensively that _Why Liberalism Failed_ fails as a diagnosis of the western liberal order because it:\n\n1. Oversimplifies liberalism and unfairly defines away its benefits,\n\n2. Is at odds with 2,500 years of western theological and philosophical thinking on human nature, and\n\n3. Is contradicted by the historical record of American social capital formation during the height of liberal ascendency\n\nSo now the question is, why was this book so successful? As my frequent readers might guess, my answer has to do with [negativity bias](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/p/our-negativity-addiction).\n\nNegativity bias [is the propensity](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/p/what-is-negativity-bias) all humans have to psychologically overweight the importance of negative events and narratives compared to positive or neutral events of the same magnitude. The bias has deep roots in [evolutionary psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023969021000254), and it impacts [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory), [investing](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/loss-aversion), [history](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677997), [sociology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191308506270059), [foreign policy](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/43/3/96/12217/Bad-World-The-Negativity-Bias-in-International?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [neuroscience](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1998-12834-004), and even [linguistics](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jel/article/5/2/025205/3336404/The-negativity-bias-is-encoded-in-language). Most importantly, however, are the repercussions negativity bias has in [politics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4477934/).\n\nPolitical news, candidates for office, and partisan narratives all [feed off of the public’s addiction to negativity](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/p/our-negativity-addiction). The more sensational and pessimistic a story or narrative is, the more attention and clicks it gets. In today’s over-saturated markets for attention, negativity is what sells, so negativity is what gets mass-produced.\n\n_Why Liberalism Failed_ is just another product of the pessimism-industrial complex. When things go wrong, the most negative explanation for why things are going wrong will tend to get the [most attention](https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618#:~:text=Negativity%20bias%20may%20have%20evolved%20as%20a,Establish%20new%20patterns%20*%20Savor%20positive%20moments). Negativity bias is a key factor in the spread of [conspiracy theories](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02106-x) for this exact reason. It is also the reason behind the long running joke that self-diagnoses on WebMD always result in a false positive [cancer diagnosis](https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/23/webmd-cancer/). When looking for a diagnosis, the most negative option is the one that subconsciously looms largest.\n\nPatrick Deneen correctly points out that many measures of social, economic, and cultural vitality are not where they could be. As with WebMD, recognizing symptoms is very different from a correct diagnosis, and I would struggle to come up with a more negative diagnosis than Deneen does for these symptoms.\n\nRather than pointing to any number of contingent recent causes like Putnam does, Deneen opts for the most negative and declinist explanation he can think of – that the very foundations of American liberalism are defective and were always inevitably going to lead to societal collapse.\n\nNot only does this explanation project pessimism all the way back to the founding and beyond, but it also minimizes room for future optimism because it argues that our entire paradigm for solving issues today, namely modern liberal democracy, is completely incapable of solving the issues. By advancing this argument, Deneen maximizes both backward-looking and forward-looking pessimism.\n\nThe success of the book, then, is not a result of high-quality historical or philosophical analysis. Its success is just the result of a market of consumers eagerly searching for negativity. In _Why Liberalism Failed_, they find it mass-produced and ready-made for public consumption under the guise of objective academic rigor. _Why Liberalism Failed_ succeeded not because it’s right, but because it’s negative.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLiberalism, rightly understood, is not the enemy of virtue, community, or social capital. It is a tradition with a deep Judeo-Christian foundation that is capable of reform and renewal, and not to mention [a comprehensive quality of life](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570) that would have been unfathomable to our ancestors.\n\nLiberalism’s current shortcomings are not the result of internal contradictions, but of our failure to uphold [our end of the bargain](https://open.substack.com/pub/travismonteleone/p/can-we-keep-it?r=1l2z5n\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=false). To avoid the declinism of Deneen and other post-liberals, we must recommit to a liberalism built on moral seriousness, grassroots community building, and the belief in our own ability to handle freedom responsibly.\n\n***\n\n*To read more and support or subscribe directly, find all of* *[Travis Monteleone's work on Substack](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/).*",
