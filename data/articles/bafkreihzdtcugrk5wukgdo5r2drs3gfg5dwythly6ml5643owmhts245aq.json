  "body": "[Watch Episode](https://wilkwilkinson.substack.com/p/peacebuilding-starts-at-home)\n\n**Peace doesn’t begin with policy.**\n**It begins with people — and it begins closer to home than most of us realize.**\n\nIn this episode of _Derate The Hate_, Wilk Wilkinson sits down with author, professor, and lifelong peacebuilder **Chip Hauss** for a deeply grounded conversation about how we move from outrage to agency in an age of polarization.\n\nChip has spent decades working at the intersection of conflict resolution, political polarization, and peacebuilding — not as an abstract theory, but as a lived practice. As a Senior Fellow for Innovation at the **Alliance for Peacebuilding** and a fellow advisor at the **ProHuman Foundation**, Chip brings both moral clarity and hard-earned optimism to some of our most complex societal challenges.\n\nWhat makes this conversation different is its _orientation_:\nNot toward fixing everything overnight — but toward **what’s actually within our reach**.\n\n***\n\n## 🧭 From Outrage to Agency\n\nTogether, Wilk and Chip explore why so many people feel stuck, disempowered, or overwhelmed — and why those feelings are often fueled by a pair of dangerous myths:\n\n1. _That there are no real solutions left_\n\n2. _That ordinary people can’t meaningfully contribute to change_\n\nChip challenges both.\n\nDrawing from decades of experience — and from everyday examples close to home — he makes a compelling case that peacebuilding doesn’t belong to elites, institutions, or distant systems of power. It belongs to **citizens willing to act with courage, curiosity, and humility** in their own spheres of influence.\n\n***\n\n## 🔹 What You’ll Hear in This Episode\n\n✔️ Why **peacebuilding starts at home**, not in Washington\n\n✔️ How **root-cause problem solving** helps us stop chasing symptoms\n\n✔️ The myths that keep people trapped in despair and inaction\n\n✔️ Why **local, citizen-led solutions** often outperform top-down fixes\n\n✔️ How curiosity — not certainty — transforms conversations across difference\n\n✔️ What **courageous citizenship** looks like in everyday life\n\n✔️ Why engaging people we disagree with can actually be _joyful_\n\n***\n\n## 📘 Peace Is a Verb, Not a Destination\n\nChip also shares insights from his book, **Peace Building Starts at Home**, including a core idea that resonates deeply with the _Derate The Hate_ mission:\n\n> Peace isn’t something we wait for.\n> It’s something we _practice_.\n\nFrom family conversations to neighborhood challenges to community-level problem solving, Chip shows how small, intentional actions can ripple outward — growing exponentially into meaningful, lasting change.\n\n***\n\n## 🌱 Who This Conversation Is For\n\nThis episode is for:\n\n* Anyone who feels exhausted by polarization\n\n* Anyone who senses they’ve lost their agency\n\n* Anyone who believes something better is possible — but isn’t sure where to start\n\nYou don’t need a megaphone.\nYou don’t need permission.\nYou just need to start where you are.\n\n***\n\n## 🔗 Resources & Links\n\n* 🕊️ **Organization:** Alliance for Peacebuilding\n\n* 📘 **Book:** _Peace Building Starts at Home_\n\n* 🌐 **Website:** <https://www.peacebuildingstartsathome.us>\n\n* 💼 **Chip Hauss on LinkedIn:** <https://www.linkedin.com/in/chip-hauss-03a64744/>\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h1_z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e66ab44-f1ed-484b-985b-5de26f2c1006_1200x643.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h1_z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e66ab44-f1ed-484b-985b-5de26f2c1006_1200x643.png)",
