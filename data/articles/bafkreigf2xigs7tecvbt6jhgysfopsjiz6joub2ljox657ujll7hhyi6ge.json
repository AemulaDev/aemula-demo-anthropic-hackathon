  "title": "Hail to the New Diet, Same as the Old Diet?",
  "preview": "Every five years, the federal government is mandated to update their \"Dietary Guidelines.\" The new one is terrific, but how much really changes? What happens next is key.",
  "body": "As a 23-year veteran of the food world, mostly on the food processing side of things, the federal government’s quinquennial issuance of official “Dietary Guidelines” is always a big deal. But a whole lot bigger to them than to Americans, who when asked, don’t know what you’re talking about. “Dietary what?”\n\nNot that anyone outside of a handful of nutrition experts, food makers (and their lobbyists), and foodies pay much attention, frankly, although they should. Despite the generally good advice - each your fruits, vegetables, and lean meats! Eat whole grains! Exercise! Wash your hands! Go easy on the saturated fat, sugars, and alcohol! - America’s general health has continued to deteriorate. Obesity rates have climbed every since since 1980 (and before), at least until last year. Most Americans suffer from at least one chronic disease. And we spend more on health care than anyone in the world.\n\nThe “Dietary Guidelines” aren’t the problem, since they’re largely unread or ignored by most Americans, but food marketers don’t seem to care, either - they’ve figured out that Americans want foods that taste good, are convenient, and are cheap. Nutrition too often takes a back seat, and is often tossed under the bus. And they’ll always focus on what consumers are interested in buying.\n\nThat is, until now.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hrju!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d2c0896-ff00-46be-a7c8-2256b3f73825_800x578.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hrju!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d2c0896-ff00-46be-a7c8-2256b3f73825_800x578.png)\n\n{{caption:Original federal government nutrition advice from 1950s.}}\n\nI remember attending meetings with fellow corporate lobbyists, especially in 2004-5 (Bush world) and again in 2009-10 (Obama Administration), as they were going through their drafting phases of those “Dietary Guidelines.” The sugar-sweetened beverage crowd was especially engaged to make sure their cash cows weren’t tarnished. Others of us didn’t want canned or frozen foods to be castigated, nor the growing bevy of snacks that probably are the biggest problem with a lot of consumers.\n\nThe government’s dietary guidelines matter for one major reason - probably a third of all the meals served and consumed everyday are subsidized by you, the taxpayer, including the roughly 3 meals a day consumed by more than 41.7 million Americans through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, used to be called “Food Stamps”) and 45 million more school children who participate in School Lunch and School Breakfast programs.\n\nAnd that doesn’t include those who participate in some 15 food and nutrition programs administered by the US Department of Agriculture.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ELA5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dcd0c60-9b7c-4ffc-9d28-5bd52a1f24f5_950x872.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ELA5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dcd0c60-9b7c-4ffc-9d28-5bd52a1f24f5_950x872.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The New “Inverted Pyramid” as part of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines}}\n\nAccording to the number of official statistics, on average, between half to two-thirds of public school children participate in those subsidized feeding programs. Some states make them all free for everyone, including California and Massachusetts.\n\nHow did I come up with that number? Our population is about [350 million](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/). On average, I’ll presume people, on average, consume three meals a day (some more, some less obviously). That’s about a billion meals consumed daily. About 41.7 million SNAP recipients, who receive an average of $182 per month, are good for about 100-120 million of those meals. Add the 45 million school lunches and breakfasts (some consumed by the same kids. _And that’s just for starters_. I’m not counting meals served to our active duty enlisted military, military academies, prisons, and the like. Add another 6-9 million meals if you wish to include them.\n\nThe point is that the Dietary Guidelines influence official food and feeding policies, from the advice they give to the mandates they impose on schools and elsewhere. Food companies care because the federal government, through programs such as the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), Women-Infants-Children (WIC) and others, buys or subsidizes food industry products. Some food companies make and market specific foods for those and other programs.\n\nI recall well the Obama Administration’s imposition of (and [backlash from school nutrition leaders](https://www.foxnews.com/health/michelle-obama-responds-to-backlash-over-healthy-school-lunches)) new school food nutrition standards that resulted from the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids act of 2010 (Democrats had massive majorities in Congress then). Food waste skyrocketed in many places (some studies dispute that, but I saw first-hand evidence), chocolate-flavored milk was banned (too much sugar, apparently, as only low-fat and skim milk was allowed) and my then-high school son started taking food to school again, finding cardboard-tasting whole-grain pizza unpalatable. The first Trump Administration wisely [rolled back those top-down mandates](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/478816-trump-administration-to-roll-back-michelle-obamas-school-lunch-rules/) and gave flexibility back to local school that allowed more options and choice.\n\n[![1960s school lunch](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAeV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a418812-69f2-443b-ada2-023a4dfdc58c_1024x768.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAeV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a418812-69f2-443b-ada2-023a4dfdc58c_1024x768.jpeg)\n\n_Side note_: I remember paying a visit to a local public school cafeteria in Penns Grove, New Jersey, during my food lobbying days around 2014. They were happy to find ways to provide healthier foods to the diverse population of children from the middle- and working-class community, but their kitchen equipment was rather dated, with lots of deep fat fryers but few microwaves and the oven capacity for baked or broiled items. They needed to invest in updated kitchens. Top-down mandates without updated kitchens were a huge challenge. Congress, beginning in 2009, appropriated $200 million per year for updating public school cafeteria kitchens. In addition, school kitchen equipment manufacturers teamed up with the School Nutrition Association to provide [grants to public schools](https://schoolnutrition.org/snf/equipment-grants/) to update equipment.\n\n[![Choose myplate.gov magnet](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-XD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9fea4c7-11e4-4b4e-89ab-92bac3b4ab89_500x465.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-XD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9fea4c7-11e4-4b4e-89ab-92bac3b4ab89_500x465.png)\n\n{{caption:The Obama Administration in 2010 migrated away from the Food Pyramid to “My Plate.” It was still heavier on grains versus protein. That much has changed for 2025.}}\n\nThe last major change to the Dietary Guidelines occurred during the Obama Administration, when they migrated from the Food Pyramid to “My Plate,” focusing on what categories of food should dominate your plate. Never mind that Americans by and large increasingly didn’t consume their meals this way (_what about bowls of soup_, I argued?). My employer at the time, Campbell Soup (now called “Campbell’s Company”) didn’t get too exercised over it because we saw soup as a great way to get vegetables (still is) and legumes (beans), along with protein. Broth-based soup is also a proven way to help control weight and calorie intake, but the Obama crowd didn’t care.\n\nNobody remembers nor cares much what the Biden Administration pushed out, because _they never did_. They assembled a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee of “experts,” but the final product was unfinished work when Donald Trump’s new team took over a year ago. The new report wastes no time criticizing what they inherited, with its focus on “equity” and race-based outcomes.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ccLD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25e7cb8c-4759-4847-8057-1f0590aac911_927x452.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ccLD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25e7cb8c-4759-4847-8057-1f0590aac911_927x452.png)\n\n{{caption:From the new Dietary Guidelines, referring to the Biden Administration’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s report.}}\n\nBut there is a remarkable consistency going back to the first report that was published by the Carter Administration in 1980. Until 2025, when they’ve literally turned things upside down.\n\n[![Food Guide Pyramid | diet | Britannica](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QYQB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe18d6c57-3334-4f65-a02b-905a18fb2140_313x315.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QYQB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe18d6c57-3334-4f65-a02b-905a18fb2140_313x315.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Who eats 6-11 servings of carbs every day?}}\n\nHere’s what hasn’t changed:\n\nEat whole foods, especially whole fruits and vegetables. ‘**We are ending the war on protein**,” the new Dietary Guidelines protest. “Every meal must prioritize high-quality, nutrient-dense protein from both animal and plant sources, paired with healthy fats from whole foods such as eggs, seafood, meats, full-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados.\n\n“Protein target: \\~0.54–0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day.”\n\n_There was never a war on protein_. Every Dietary Guideline going back to 1980 promoted lean protein. And they’re proposing _way more_ protein than you really need. Fifty grams of protein is more than enough for any American, unless you’re in a body building competition or playing on the defensive or offensive line of an NFL football team. Even then.\n\nThere are about 12 grams of protein in a large egg. More if you add ham, sausage, hamburger, steak, cheese, or a variety of other forms of protein our there. Since I’ve been on “fat shots” the past year, I suck down a protein shake every morning that’s worth about 20 grams, plus collagen and fiber. And there’s only two brief mentions of fiber-rich foods in the new Dietary Guidelines. Fiber is just as important as protein. They go hand in hand, in fact. Fiber has lots of other health benefits.\n\nWhat has changed is the change of focus from grains to protein, and the de-emphasis of saturated fats, concerns about which predominated in the 1970s and throughout previous Dietary Guidelines, over concerns of it contributions to heart disease. And grains, except for 2-4 servings of “whole” grains, including nuts.\n\nThose concerns haven’t abated, but they’re now taking a back seat. Robert F. Kennedy, the trial lawyer turned HHS Secretary has successfully returned beef tallow to menus. That, despite the work of many of over the years to reduce saturated fats to successfully reduce incidents of heart disease. We’re now about to see if a comeback is in order. “Seed oils,” like Canola and Vegetable oils, replaced beef tallow as healthier alternatives. The debate rages on just whether it was successful or not.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H8fW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44adea46-8fc9-49be-9086-6ef54f4f5379_582x693.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H8fW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44adea46-8fc9-49be-9086-6ef54f4f5379_582x693.png)\n\nBottom line: While grains and so-called “ultra processed foods” (still largely undefined) are castigated in the report, the basic diet hasn’t changed that much. Watch your calories, get plenty of protein, eat your whole fruits and vegetables, enjoy dairy products, and get some exercise.\n\nThe real issue is what you do with these multi-year, multi-stakeholder efforts once their published. How about re-instigating real nutrition education programs in schools?\n\nI’ve written about them before, combining nutrition with education and physical education. That was left out of the report, and the Department of Education was no where mentioned in the report. That’s too bad. That tells me this one will die on the vine like all the others.\n\nNice try, Trump Administration, but what are you going to do about all this? I’m not persuaded you’ll do anything that really works, or is needed. And that’s too bad.",
