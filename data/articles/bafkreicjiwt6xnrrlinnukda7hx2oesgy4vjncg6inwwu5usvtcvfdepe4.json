Not a lab result. A date circled in red, six months out, when the insurance plan renews and the math might finally stop working. Until then, you ration refills, postpone scans, and make a quiet inventory of what you can afford to ignore. People don’t talk about this part much—the way time itself becomes a cost center—but it’s everywhere if you listen closely enough.²\n\nBy 2028, the United States will face a choice it has postponed for half a century. We can keep pretending our system is merely inefficient, or we can admit what it actually is: a structurally inverted machine that maximizes extraction at the expense of care. Fixing it won’t require a miracle. It will require discipline, sequencing, and a willingness to stop subsidizing failure.³\n\nThe good news—rare in this domain—is that we already know how to build best-in-world health care. The evidence is sitting in plain sight, across borders and within our own system. The problem has never been design. It’s been power.⁴\n\nThe first rule of repair is to stop confusing health care with insurance.\n\nAmerica does not have a health care system so much as a payment labyrinth that happens to include hospitals. We spend nearly twice as much per capita as other wealthy nations and get less life expectancy, worse chronic disease control, and higher maternal mortality in return.⁵ That gap is not clinical. It is administrative and political.⁶\n\nA serious post-2028 plan starts by collapsing the number of payers—not to one overnight, but to a disciplined, standardized core. The fastest path is not a sudden leap to single payer, which would trigger institutional panic and endless litigation. It is a public option that is boring, universal, and impossible to opt out of over time.⁷\n\nMedicare already exists. It works. It is popular. The trick is to expand it downward and outward—first to everyone over 55, then to children, then to anyone who wants in—while simultaneously standardizing reimbursement rules across private plans. The goal is not to outlaw private insurance. It is to make it redundant.⁸\n\nThis matters because cost control does not come from price caps alone. It comes from simplicity. Every hospital administrator in America can tell you how many staff hours are burned reconciling billing codes across dozens of insurers. Eliminate that friction, and you free billions before touching a scalpel.⁹\n\nBut coverage is only the chassis. The engine is primary care—and this is where the American system quietly collapses.\n\nWe have built a country where it is easier to see a specialist than a generalist, easier to get a procedure than a conversation. That is not an accident. It is a reimbursement choice.¹⁰ If you want best-in-world outcomes, you pay for continuity, not heroics.¹¹\n\nThe post-2028 plan must do something radical by American standards and utterly mundane elsewhere: guarantee every person a primary care clinician with a capped panel size and a salaried model. No fee-for-service hamster wheel. No incentive to rush. Just time, accountability, and prevention.¹²\n\nCountries that do this—quietly, relentlessly—catch disease earlier, spend less on catastrophic interventions, and trust their systems more. We know this because we can measure it.¹³ The resistance is not empirical. It is cultural and financial.\n\nWhich brings us to drugs—the most visible, obscene failure in the American model.\n\nThe United States subsidizes global pharmaceutical innovation and then pretends this is an act of generosity rather than leverage. We pay the highest prices in the world for medications whose research we often helped fund, then forbid our own government from negotiating aggressively on our behalf.¹⁴ This is not market capitalism. It is self-imposed extortion.¹⁵\n\nA best-in-world system after 2028 would do three things simultaneously. It would expand federal price negotiation to all high-volume drugs. It would enforce international reference pricing. And it would break the patent abuse pipeline that allows minor reformulations to reset monopolies indefinitely.¹⁶\n\nNone of this requires new science. It requires spine.\n\nThe same applies to hospitals.\n\nThe quiet secret of American health care costs is that they are driven less by wages or technology than by consolidation. Over the past two decades, hospital systems have swallowed competitors, negotiated higher prices, and justified it all in the language of “efficiency.” The result has been fewer choices, higher bills, and no measurable improvement in outcomes.¹⁷\n\nA serious reform agenda uses antitrust law as health policy. It blocks further consolidation. It forces price transparency that actually means something. And it ties nonprofit hospital status to measurable community benefit, not branding exercises.¹⁸\n\nIf a hospital receives tax exemptions, it should prove—annually—that it is reducing uncompensated care, expanding access, and improving outcomes in its service area. Otherwise, it pays taxes like everyone else.¹⁹\n\nThen there is the workforce.\n\nAmerica does not have a doctor shortage so much as a maldistribution crisis wrapped in educational debt.²⁰ We train clinicians at enormous cost, then funnel them into subspecialties and urban centers because that is where survival is financially possible.²¹\n\nFixing this is not complicated. It requires tuition-free medical and nursing education tied to service commitments, expanded scope-of-practice for non-physician clinicians, and immigration policies that welcome trained health workers rather than wasting their skills.²²\n\nOther countries treat health workforce planning as infrastructure. We treat it as an accident. That alone explains much of the gap.²³\n\nTechnology, meanwhile, needs to be demoted from savior to tool.\n\nElectronic records should talk to each other. Data should follow patients. AI should reduce clerical burden, not generate new billing games. The measure of success is not innovation theater but minutes returned to care.²⁴\n\nAnd yes, this all costs money—just less than what we already spend badly.²⁵\n\nThe political mistake reformers make is arguing that better health care requires higher spending. The truth is harsher and more persuasive: we are already paying for a Rolls-Royce system and driving it into a ditch.²⁶ The task is to reallocate, not explode the budget.\n\nThe sequencing matters. Coverage expansion first. Cost controls embedded early. Workforce reform alongside reimbursement change. Drug pricing in parallel. Antitrust throughout.²⁷ Do this in pieces, transparently, with pilots and metrics, and the panic subsides.\n\nWhat cannot happen—what has failed every time—is half-reform. Tweaks that preserve the extraction model while promising relief later.²⁸ That path leads exactly where we are now.\n\nThe moral argument, finally, is not abstract.\n\nA system that ties survival to employment, geography, and luck is not merely inefficient. It is corrosive. It teaches people to delay care, to hide illness, to fear time. It turns health into a private gamble and then acts surprised when the house wins.²⁹\n\nBest-in-world health care after 2028 is not a fantasy. It is a decision. Other countries made it decades ago. We have simply been negotiating with the wrong stakeholders.³⁰\n\nIf the next administration wants a legacy that actually lasts, it will stop asking whether America can afford universal, affordable care—and start asking why we tolerate anything less.³¹\n\n⸻\n\n**Biibliography**\n\n1\\.
