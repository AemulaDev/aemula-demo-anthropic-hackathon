  "body": "Peer pressure is a real thing.\n\nSometimes it’s a good thing, other times it’s a bad thing, but it’s real.\n\nThat pressure by others to conform, to go with the flow, often tends to stifle one’s unique voice. On the other hand, that same pressure is a powerful motivator to exercise proper care in how we speak about others.\n\nI’ve never been one to follow the herd; I prize my uniqueness almost to a fault. However, I know all too well that uniqueness is not an excuse for being rude to others.\n\nThese competing forces help me consider what I think is the most important question related to whether I should post something on social media: _Am I prepared to defend this post?_\n\nAlternatively, this question could be phrased as: _Am I willing to stand behind what I write?_\n\nMany things come to mind when I consider this question:\n\n* Who is my expected audience for this post?\n\n* How could this post be reasonably understood by others?\n\n* Have I done enough research on the topic related to the post?\n\n* How much time am I willing to spend discussing this post?\n\n* What objections could people reasonably bring up?\n\nOf course, I could go through this routine and still write something indefensible, but the chances of that happening are a bit lower if I’ve exercised care in what I write and post.\n\nThis kind of care is less about popularity and more about credibility. I have little control over how popular I am, but I have considerable control over how credible I appear. That being said, credibility often (but not always) helps with popularity as well.\n\nHolding to the position that I should be able to defend what I write has had one peculiar outcome for me: I look back over my old posts, and I still like what I wrote back then. I stand by what I wrote as much today as I did the day I wrote it. There are probably exceptions to this, but I can’t think of any at the moment.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What are the essential elements of a defensible piece of writing or social media post?",
