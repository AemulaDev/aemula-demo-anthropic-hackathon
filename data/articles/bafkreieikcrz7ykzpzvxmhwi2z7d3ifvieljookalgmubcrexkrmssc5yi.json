Before you load up on pizza, salad, or that questionable five-layer casserole, you have one choice that shapes the entire experience: paper or ceramic. Paper is flimsy and disposable, while ceramic is sturdier. It won’t collapse halfway through your meal, though it does need cleaning.\n\nThat plate choice is the perfect stand-in for your investment accounts. Some are objectively better, some are situational, and all will shape how your financial feast plays out. Last week, in _[From Café Lattes to Dining Hall Buffets](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/from-cafe-lattes-to-dining-hall-buffets?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, I explained why the S\\&P 500 is the buffet table of the American economy. This week, we’re zooming in on what you actually eat off of: the plates and utensils of investing.\n\n## Pick Your Plate\n\nJust like banks have checking, savings, and CDs, the investing world has its own menu of accounts. Here’s a sample of the most prominent for an individual investor.\n\n* **Taxable brokerage:** the basic, paper-plate option. Flexible, no contribution caps, but every bite is taxed (capital gains, dividends).\n\n* **Roth IRA** (_Individual Retirement Account_)**:** the ceramic plate. Pay taxes now, feast tax-free later.\n\n* **Traditional IRA:** a tax-deferred account. You pay less tax now but more when you withdraw. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than when you’re contributing.\n\nFor a young investor, the Roth always comes first. Other accounts are fine once you’ve maxed your Roth or want more flexibility, but start with the sturdier dish. Additionally, with any IRA, you can’t touch your profits without penalty until age 59½, so plan on time for growth.\n\n## The Ceramic Winner: Roth IRA\n\nThe Roth IRA is the uncontested choice for young investors. Contributions go in after tax, and from there, all the profits grow tax-free — forever. That latte-to-retirement math we did in _From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million_? In a Roth, Uncle Sam doesn’t touch a dime.\n\nCreated in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act, the Roth IRA allows you to contribute up to $7,000 per year. The limit will increase over time, and if you’re over 50, you’re eligible for catch-up contributions of $8,000. Income limits kick in around $150,000, but for most students and early-career workers, that’s not even on the radar— even $15,000 might not be!\n\nTo qualify, you need to have earned income from a summer lifeguarding gig, a restaurant job, or any other form of compensation that requires a tax form, such as a W-2. You can contribute up to the amount you earned, so if you made $5,000, you can put in $5,000.\n\n**Quick tax note:** Yes, you pay income tax upfront. But with part-time income, your tax liability is usually tiny or even zero if you’re under the \\~$15,000 standard deduction. Paying a little now to avoid taxes on decades of compounding is a trade you’ll thank yourself for later.\n\nThe Roth also offers flexibility: you can withdraw your _contributions_ (not profits) penalty-free at any time.\n\nThere is also a special one-time allowance to withdraw $10,000 of profits for a first-time home purchase. Although the benefit of taking out some Roth profits and contributions is alluring, keep in mind that re-contributing to your account is not allowed. The money you remove cannot be re-added to continue their compounding journey, leaving you with a smaller base of cash to grow.\n\n## Your Utensils: Picking Your Brokerage\n\nIf the account is the plate, the brokerage is your utensil. Try eating lasagna with a spork and you’ll see why the choice matters.\n\nPopular brokers include Robinhood, E\\*Trade, Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity. My pick is **[Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/overview?ranid=RL7M2q*4kuk\\&linkid=1163\\&immid=100734_AFF\\&utm_campaign_id=100734\\&utm_source=N805.3606008RAKUTEN_PROGRAMMATIC\\&utm_campaign=BRK\\&utm_medium=AFF\\&utm_content=422322290\\&imm_pid=422322290\\&utm_term=a616700964\\&imm_aid=a616700964\\&utm_account_id=3849093\\&utm_id=33038438\\&dfid=\\&buf=99999999\\&link=1163\\&ransiteid=RL7M2q.4kuk-wG.7e5CQQQE69RMRhe7hnw\\&ranMID=47250\\&ranEAID=RL7M2q*4kuk\\&ranSiteID=RL7M2q.4kuk-wG.7e5CQQQE69RMRhe7hnw)**, which offers:\n\n* Fractional shares (buying $5 of Amazon instead of one full share for $225).\n\n* Zero-commission trades on ETFs, stocks, and more.\n\n* Clean interface and strong customer service.\n\n* Cash management account integration (and credit card!).\n\nVanguard and E\\*Trade have the legacy rep, but their platforms feel clunky and outdated. Robinhood is sleek but built for trading, not long-term retirement building. Fidelity and Schwab both balance modern tools with a focus on long-term investing. Fidelity edges out the pack with fractional shares and a smoother ecosystem, providing you with a complete set of utensils instead of a single fork.\n\n## Why This Dinnerware Matters\n\nLet’s come back to the dining hall. You can pile your tray high, but if you’re balancing it on a paper plate, good luck making it back to the table without the top layer of your casserole falling off. A Roth IRA is that sturdy ceramic plate. Load it up while you’re young, let compounding do its work, and by the time you hit 59½, you’ll have hundreds of thousands — if not seven figures — that taxes can’t touch. Maxing out each year is a huge accomplishment, but even smaller contributions are essential. The earlier you start, the better.\n\n_Paper or ceramic was just the start. The real game is what you load on top, and next week we’ll dig into ETFs and why the Nasdaq index deserves its own spotlight_.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
