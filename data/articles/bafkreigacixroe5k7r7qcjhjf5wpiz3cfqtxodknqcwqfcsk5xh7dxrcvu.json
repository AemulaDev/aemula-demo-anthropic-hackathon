  "body": "Over the years I’ve worked on media from many different angles, often in a sector that people call “media innovation.” So I’ve put some thought into what genuine innovation — and, perhaps, reform — would mean. Like most things I think about, I think of this primarily as a spiritual question; and there are also questions of form, as there always are, and there are material elements of process, too. I have been trying to figure out how to write about these questions, and about the ideals I hope to instantiate in my work. Here is a new attempt.\n\nSometimes people are surprised when I say I don’t always think of myself as a journalist. Don’t get me wrong: I’ve been a writer for a long time, and I’ve written across styles; and mostly I write nonfiction. But to me, only a few of the nonfiction pieces I’ve written feel like they “count” as journalism, by which I mean Journalism: Journalism as its own thing. Capital-J Journalism. Which is kind of hard to define.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZD4_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a01d018-1d00-466e-af64-5cd928a1541a_3000x2214.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZD4_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a01d018-1d00-466e-af64-5cd928a1541a_3000x2214.png)\n\n{{caption:“The Journalist, from Boswell’s Tour of the Hebrides,” by Thomas Rowlandson, 1786. From the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.}}\n\nA beloved ex-partner of mine (I’m sure he’s reading this! hi!) used to teach in the Journalism program at Columbia University. He invited me to visit his class at Pulitzer Hall, so I can tell you that it feels like a church. “Truth” is emblazoned all over the place. Among certain people with certain ideals, this idealism is a kind of Tradition: I remember my father explaining to me, when I was a little girl, that great journalists defy court orders and go to jail if they must, to protect the names of their sources and their own integrity.\n\nSince I was raised to take it so seriously, I find that I often complain about the relationship between Truth and Journalism these days. At the same time, I must admit that Journalism has a remarkable truth-seeking mentality, infrastructure, and process all its own, which, at its best, involves rigorous fact-checking, as well as specific expectations about how information is handled to prevent conflicts of interest.\\[1] While its processes are imperfect, I have come to deeply respect this body of practice.\n\nAnd so, despite my critiques of the mainstream media, I’ve tried to integrate the best of Journalism into my truth-seeking aspirations. But I always end up feeling like I’m coloring outside the lines. When I launched my magazine, _[The New Modality](https://thenewmodality.com/),_ in 2019, I felt so uncomfortable and torn about industry standards that I included a central page about epistemology, in which I discussed industry standards of misinformation and fact-checking, and outlined a brief plan for handling those things. (I have since retired that website, but you can [click here to see an archived version of the epistemology page](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425123751/http://thenewmodality.com/epistemology-rundown-truth-and-transparency-at-the-new-modality/).) A couple years after the magazine launch, when I got into the so-called “dissident right” movement, I was then, also, partially driven by my dissatisfaction with Journalism and by my craving to innovate on new forms. Here’s how I [described](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-was-part-of-the-neoreactionary) one experiment I ran during that period, which I named “The Territory:”\n\n> I launched an internal skunkworks project within _New Modality,_ which I named “The Territory.” I didn’t have a job and was living off savings, but everyone I knew was still saying things like “maybe the pandemic will be over soon;” anyway, I couldn’t go out and network because socializing among Blue Tribe was verboten. So I doubled down on R\\&D. (This was also a period of my life where I prayed and meditated a lot, trying to work through core spiritual questions.) I reasoned that, if I was about to go big, then I needed to restructure my organization and gain a new understanding of the market. My idea behind “The Territory” was to develop a community of people with different networks, all who cared deeply about good epistemology, though they had different experiences informing what that meant to them.\n>\n> I wanted to solidify a cohesive group that could communicate across different identities and party lines, whose members were naturally motivated to track different areas of interest, who saw the value in sharing that information back with each other and potentially influencing the Discourse. I planned to eventually combine the group with a small, speedy media company structure: For example, what might we create, if community members in The Territory could work with professional fact-checkers and journalists to develop stories? For about a year, I sank hours every day into this experiment. The hardest part was making it so the Red Tribe and Blue Tribe people weren’t constantly triggering each other; I broke up a lot of fights.\n>\n> _— from “[Why I Was Part Of The Neoreactionary or Dissident Right Movement In 2020](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-was-part-of-the-neoreactionary)”_\n\nThis experiment didn’t end quite how I thought it would, but I learned a lot and I’d potentially do a new version of it, if I could get financial support to run it.\n\nWhat I want, I guess, is to do the best possible job instantiating the _ideal_ of Journalism. It’s just that my natural tendencies of form seem different from how the larger industry thinks about things? Another way to say this is that the longer I do this, the more I see that there’s a lot of valuable stuff I do, which is probably Journalism, I guess? — yet that stuff is not well-understood or well-supported by the practice of Journalism.\n\nI’m interested in finding ways to do this stuff _as an ongoing professional practice_ — but it’s tricky. Here are two examples.\n\n**Example The First: Community Networks in Crisis**\n\nBack in July, I wrote a post called “[The Media and the Polycrisis](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/the-media-and-the-polycrisis)” in which I tried to express a core problem I see with the media in 2025. To frame the post, I opened with a scenario where I did some research to help survivors of the Asheville hurricane. Here’s some of what I wrote:\n\n> Soon after Hurricane Helene hit Asheville, an acquaintance posted on Facebook that the survivors needed “research help.” I saw her post and offered to help out, as long as it was research I could do on my phone while watching my toddler. She told me there had been an unidentified major chemical spill during the hurricane. This, among other things, tainted the water. In some places, when survivors tried to drink water, including water from faucets in their kitchens, the water burned their mouths. When they waded through mud to rescue friends and family, the mud burned their skin.\n>\n> This posed several immediate problems. For example, survivors had to source hazmat suits to wear while wading through the mud; by the time I got involved, that was covered. Meanwhile, they were not sure what to do about the water in their faucets. For example, maybe there was a way to purify it, so that people could drink tap water without fear? This was the sort of question she asked me to research.\n>\n> _\\[Here the post includes several paragraphs detailing the complications of this research]_\n>\n> … After spending a day or two researching these questions, I did my best to usefully organize what I’d learned, and sent it to my acquaintance in Asheville. They co-created a shared document that got passed around their community for a while (the document seemed largely correct at the time I reviewed it). As part of my research process I wrote a Facebook post, where I recruited help from my friends with relevant expertise, and then, when I was done researching, I updated [the post](https://www.facebook.com/shataina/posts/pfbid0xwnZuW7sHT3R9f5zgWe81JBcaWnKesGtk6LuR6WoZMpSUPgf1qXFsxDVKYUCZwXwl) with what I learned.\n>\n> I tried to make my words as clear as I could while still being accurate, but it was hard because the questions have complicated answers. I had no good way to follow up to find out whether people got the right information at the right time, based on the research I did. I hope it was helpful.\n>\n> _— from “[The Media and the Polycrisis](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/the-media-and-the-polycrisis)”_\n\nA few times since then, the woman who originally asked for research help has messaged me thanking me again. Recently, I asked her if she has feedback about what exactly was helpful about what I did. (I don’t think this is the best way to figure out how and whether I was really helpful, but it’s the best one I have access to right now.\\[2]) Here is her response, quoted with permission:\n\n> I do remember two main ways that you were helpful. One was that you opened your network up to me by posting on our behalf! This helped enormously because I believe you have an unusually strong network of highly educated and connected folks. Experts reached out to me and made introductions to others, enough so that I was able to get all the essential information I needed —and fast! Within a week or two.\n>\n> The second helpful thing you did was being active in post comments. You helped clarify questions or answers and tag people in to weigh-in, if I’m remembering correctly. You have a great handle on information synthesis and what might be missing or on/off topic. Both these things were enormously helpful!\n\nOn the surface this process — where I post on social media and collate the answers — is incredibly simple. Yet, as she notes, the reasons I can effectively _use_ the process are (a) I’ve spent a lot of time meticulously building my network, and (b) I have also spent a lot of time figuring out how to ask helpful questions and organize information helpfully.\n\nDid this social media process count as Journalism? To my mind, yes. When I wrote “[The Media and the Polycrisis](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/the-media-and-the-polycrisis),” I also linked it to some R\\&D product work I did for a journalism company in my early thirties, so I suspect that some journalists would agree that this counts as Journalism; but probably some others wouldn’t see it that way.\n\nThere have been one or two attempts to build Real Journalism startups where employees are one hundred percent posting on social media and there isn’t a dedicated website. I don’t think I’ve seen any of these succeed, but does that mean it’s not Journalism, or simply that those specific methods aren’t straightforwardly fundable?\n\nI think of media as broadly serving three functions: Inspiration, information, and community. Within this rubric, I think of Journalism as a media subtype, primarily focused on information and valuing truth above everything else, though it also serves the other two functions. In crises, I think the job of Journalism is to get true, up-to-the-minute, and relevant information to people affected by the crisis. I also think much of Journalism doesn’t do this. The process I set in motion on social media for my Asheville friend is an example of me trying to do this in the best way that seemed available at the time. However, it did not result in any articles or any other outputs that would normally count as Journalism, and certainly nothing that would be easy to systematize or monetize.\n\n**Example The Second: “Healing Journalism” During Article Research**\n\nFor the last couple of years I’ve been working on a hotly anticipated article. The article is about Leverage Research (if you know what that is, then you know why this article is hotly anticipated). The people at the center of the article gave me exclusive access because they trust me and they think I will do a decent, fair job of the project. This, in theory, seems like it should be exactly how journalism generally works. Right?\n\nIn fact, this is rarely how journalism works, especially right now. A very large amount of the most prestigious journalism in the USA today is produced by organizations that are:\n1\\. Located in New York City, with minimal connection to almost all the communities they cover, and also governed by very specific incentives within their own communities.\n2\\. Created and staffed largely by people who either inherited so much money that they don’t need to work, or have some other way to maintain a middle- to upper-class lifestyle that has nothing to do with their jobs, which are typically poorly paid. (These jobs are poorly paid partly as a result of the fact that the industry is full of people who already have money, resulting in a predictable and circular economic dynamic within the profession.)\n\nWithin the journalism industry, there’s a decent amount of accountability about raw facts due to the fact-checking apparatuses at these organizations, which in turn are heavily incentivized by the way libel law works in the USA, i.e.: Factual truth is a defense in court if someone tries to sue.\n\nHowever, as far as I can tell, there is pretty much zero institutional accountability for journalists who screw over sources or who don’t care about the impact of their work on the communities they cover. Practically speaking, subjects of stories have little choice about which journalists cover their story, and little access to the information they’d need to choose between journalists on the rare occasions they do have a choice.\n\nMy work on the Leverage Research story has involved a fair amount of talking to people about trauma, and a huge amount of frame-defining and epistemic questioning. This is a particularly hard story. So, I don’t normally do big Journalism stories like this in the first place, _and_ this is a hard one to do responsibly, so those are some of the reasons it is taking so long. But another reason it’s taken a long time is that I have become invested in the process as more than just documentation. I didn’t go in with this explicit intention, but it became apparent to me during dozens of hours of interviews that the process could be _healing._\n\nThe healing potential of the process felt more and more awe-inspiring to me over time, and the details of how it works are fascinating. For example, even when sources already know me, additional gravitas is imparted by vestments and rituals: The microphone; the way I always begin an official journalistic conversation with a particular cue for the recording;[3] the tone that I take during journalistic interviews. It probably helps that Leverage 1.0[4] existed in the same cultural ecosystem [where I initially started learning about woo](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/what-its-like-to-suddenly-start-completely-believing-in-god), and the researchers and I share some psychology techniques, which means we have many shared moral norms and spiritual touchstones, and our conversations about the psychology involved are highly specific and precise when compared to most conversations I have with most people.\n\nWhat would it mean to make a practice that might be called “Healing Journalism:” Journalism intentionally structured not only to document and tell the truth, but to heal people and communities? The initial steps I’ve taken while working on the Leverage story have felt inspiring, but often this has also been draining. To some extent we’ll know the process by its fruits; I hope I live up, at least somewhat, to the ideal in my mind. At the same time, the process already has some fruits, in the sense that some had the chance to share their perspectives and frameworks and stories, and information has moved through the community. Sometimes during these interviews, people cried or told me that talking about what happened was helping them far more than they’d expected; the ability to be present with them has felt like a gift and also, sometimes, a responsibility that I feel intimidated by. For me, this has made more standard journalistic interview processes feel almost tawdry at times, like strip-mining.\n\nUnlike the Asheville example, this process will (in theory) result in a normal journalistic output eventually: The story itself. However, similarly to the Asheville example, this may be a hard thing to systematize or monetize. I’m certainly not being paid anything close to a reasonable hourly rate, and most journalists at normal journalism companies would not have the time to do this the way I’m doing it.\n\n**So What’s The Product, Then?**\n\nAnd so here lies the rub. If this is the work I want to do, then… what _is_ the work I want to do? By which I mean: Is there some way I can get paid to do what seems best to do with my skills, so that I can devote my time to doing that stuff? How do I even _express what the thing is_ that I’m trying to do?\n\nThere’s a sense in which these questions don’t matter because no matter what, I’ll probably find a way to keep doing stuff like this, at least with some of my time, even if finances or health or logistics force me to do other stuff with much of my time.\\[5] However, now that I’m a mom, I have less time to spare, and I also think the projects are generally better served when I can work full-time. If I want to figure out how to do whatever-it-is-that-I-do full time, then I have to find ways to define, articulate, structure it. This post has been another step in that direction.\n\n—\n\n_**Update, 11/19/25:**_ **Writing and Money.** A friend of mine from Journalism Land read this and texted me to say that they “don’t think most professional journalists are financed in some other way,” and so they asked me if I have data to support this.\n\nMy claim is primarily based on observation, but perhaps is influenced by envy! With that said, there are two articles I recommend on this topic, both of which support my claim. The first is Ann Bauer’s 2015 piece in _Salon,_ “[‘Sponsored’ by my husband: Why it’s a problem that writers never talk about where their money comes from.](https://www.salon.com/2015/01/25/sponsored_by_my_husband_why_its_a_problem_that_writers_never_talk_about_where_their_money_comes_from/)” I _love_ that article because I think Bauer absolutely nails the dynamics of this problem, including why the problem is difficult to spot and discuss. (Note that she isn’t just talking about journalism, though she mentions journalism; she is discussing the writing industry more broadly.)\n\nThe other is Noreen Malone’s 2018 piece in _New York Magazine,_ in which [she discusses how and why the](https://archive.is/2020.01.31-062813/http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/the-new-yorker-staff-wants-to-unionize.html) _[New Yorker](https://archive.is/2020.01.31-062813/http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/the-new-yorker-staff-wants-to-unionize.html)_ [(a separate publication) was unionizing at the time](https://archive.is/2020.01.31-062813/http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/the-new-yorker-staff-wants-to-unionize.html). Here are two specific quotations that I think are outrageous — at least if you assume that the industry isn’t trying to exclude people who don’t have an outside source of income:\n\n> Writers at _The_ _New Yorker_ are nearly all independent contractors, rather than staff, and thus do not receive health care or other benefits, despite being largely prevented from writing for other outlets. The relatively few editorial staffers who’ve expressed concerns with the unionizing effort say they are worried about retaliation in an industry where reputation is the coin of the realm.\n\nand\n\n> “We’ve been told for years that because you get prestige, you don’t get money,” said one print staffer who asked to discuss salary considerations anonymously because of the potential professional consequences. The staffer pointed out that cost of living in New York has far outstripped pay increases at the publication. “You have to be independently wealthy, or have an alternate form of funds, to afford to take these jobs, and many people come from the same pool of Harvard or Yale,” the staffer said (adding that, despite the editor-in-chief’s alma mater, “Princeton is not in vogue at _The New Yorker_ anymore”).\n\nSo, there you go. I will also add that this is my overwhelming impression, too — as a person in the industry who cares deeply about it, and who has often (though not always!) had to figure out ways to support my work monetarily that aren’t money earned by the work itself.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about money and media, I recommend [Jane Friedman’s newsletter](https://janefriedman.com/the-bottom-line-janes-publishing-industry-newsletter/).\n\nAlso, since I am nothing if not a hustler for my media work: If this inspires you to support me monetarily, then you can [subscribe here](http://lydialaurenson.substack.com/subscribe) or check out my longer post that talks about my various projects, “[How And Why To Send Me Money](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-send-me-money-redux).”\n\n—\n\n•\n\n***\n\n[1] If you think journalism has no respectable body of practice, the _AP Stylebook_ is a good thing to read. I know this because that partner I mentioned, the one who taught in Pulitzer Hall, once asked me to read his copy of the _AP Stylebook_ when he felt that I was making off-base critiques of mainstream media — and he was right. (Full disclosure: I didn’t finish reading it at the time. For my sins, I’ve ordered myself a new copy.)\n\n[2] The question of how to get a realistic view of whether one’s work is useful is one that I originally got paranoid about during [my Peace Corps service](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/the-time-i-joined-peace-corps-and), but I also learned to worry about this question a lot throughout my experience in technology and journalism. It’s just so easy for a certain personality type to get wrapped up in believing you’re being helpful when you’re not (and I am that personality type, or at least I share numerous traits with it).\n\n[3] This seems like a good time to note a standard part of my practice. If you are part of a community I frequent, I will never consider your words to be fair game for quotation unless I have them recorded during a _mutually agreed_ recording session, which will be completely obvious when we are doing it because I will begin by saying something like: “This is Lydia Laurenson here with \\[name] on \\[date] for the \\[story] and I am now recording.”\n\nThe only scenarios in which I ever expect to break this rule are situations where something evil (like child abuse) has occurred and the person I want to quote is blatantly complicit. Consent matters to me a lot!\n\nThis is not, however, a standard you can expect from most journalists, so be careful out there.\n\nI’m happy to discuss this further with people who are part of communities where I hang out. Also, I think a lot about this process, and I’m trying to write about it more, so if you’re _really_ interested then you might find my recent post “[Thoughts on Concealment and Revelation](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-concealment-and-revelation)” worth reading (it’s about the standards I hold around non-consensually outing people), and/or [the post I wrote after I was quoted on the record](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/about-the-curtis-yarvin-new-yorker) in a _New Yorker_ story about my ex-fiancé.\n\n\\[4] There is still an organization called Leverage Research. Many people refer to the period of Leverage about which I’m writing my article as Leverage 1.0 and the current phase as Leverage 2.0.\n\n[5] I have a totally different relationship to work from most people I know: I want money so I can do work that seems to need doing. I have generally managed to fulfill this urge. Many of my friends describe me as an artist, and in this, my process is similar to that of many artists, with [many of the same questions and internal paradoxes](https://essays.fnnch.com/make-a-living).\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
