  "body": "_Part III of a four-part series on predictions and resolutions for 2026. The next one will focus on my certain-to-be-unmet wishes from Washington and a few state policy makers. Previous versions can be found_ _[here](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/part-i-predictions-and-resolutions)_ _and_ _[here](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/part-ii-resolutions-for-me-and-thee)._\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nLast week, I focused on my top resolution for all of us in 2026 - better balancing our media diets. Today, we focus on three things: depoliticizing and unplugging The Outrage Machine™; limiting and “reforming” our social media diets and replacing it with books (including recommendations!), _especially on history_, and connecting with neighbors; and rediscovering faith, which may be the most fundamental and important of any resolution.\n\n**Engage in Politics, but Don’t Politicize Everything**\n\nI’ve just been elected as the new chair of my electoral district here in Western Loudoun County. The Catoctin District is the largest geographically and arguably the most Republican of the districts, encompassing half the county’s real estate, but we’re woefully unorganized and alarmingly disengaged - not a single precinct captain in my jurisdiction.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Muei!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85d1a394-d90b-4f79-9384-5634e5ff65bd_1037x807.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Muei!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85d1a394-d90b-4f79-9384-5634e5ff65bd_1037x807.png)\n\nI wasn’t planning on getting reengaged with party politics, although I’m happy to help the occasional friend or acquaintance running for office with counsel and pro-bono assistance. But I was horribly embarrassed that my Republican state house delegate, in a “light red” district, narrowly lost his reelection to a hard-left progressive not because he ran a poor campaign - he ran a great campaign, actually - but due to a very low turnout of Republicans. I am now without representation in Richmond or in Washington. Instead, I’m “represented” by deluded progressive Democrats with a never-ending thirst for more of my money and policies that will make Virginia even less affordable, from higher electricity prices to our leaving infamous car tax untouched.\n\nThey’re not rotten; just _wrong_.\n\nSo, I decided to do something about it. I’m stepping up to take charge with plans to mobilize GOP turnout for several key races where I live in 2026 and 2027. We have a terrific county GOP chair and I am eager to work with him. I’m more aware than ever of this: All it takes for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing, a paraphrase wrongly attributed to Edmund Burke. I suspect that actions out of Richmond will help motivate GOP voters in the next election.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PKia!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3f098da-b0e1-4893-a048-b934b229398a_1248x818.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PKia!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3f098da-b0e1-4893-a048-b934b229398a_1248x818.png)\n\nBut just because I’m getting politically reengaged doesn’t mean that I’m going to get “more political.” In fact, since embracing more civil political communication over the past decade, I have endeavored, in all my engagements with individuals or couples, never to be the first one to bring up politics or public officials (not always succeeding). I’ll do it here, obviously, but never with my neighbors, at family or Holiday gatherings, and even with those I share lots of political history and experience.\n\nWhy? Because I tire of _everything_ being politicized, from horrendous mass shootings to most everything scientific, from COVID to “climate change.” Political motives are ascribed to almost everything, and that’s not healthy (even if it is sometimes true, as any visit to the social media site, X, consistently demonstrates).\n\n> Politicization is the last refuge of the scoundrel. To “politicize” something — hurricanes, intelligence, science, football, gun violence — is to render it political in a way that distorts its true meaning. That, at least, seems to be the reasoning of those who use the term as an insult: _We_ adhere to pristine, unadulterated facts and call for unity; _they_ politicize those facts for partisan gain and divide us even more.\n>\n> Jennifer Szalai, _[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/magazine/why-is-politicization-so-partisan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.BFA.TbzT.BdzgJipbgQ-x\\&smid=url-share)_, 2017\n\nWhen someone tries to politicize a situation, it’s best to remember Occam’s Razor: _the simplest, most elegant explanation is usually the one closest to the truth_. Or even Hanlon’s Razor: \"_Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity._\" We should also encourage our politicians to embrace a notion that’s become out of favor: politics should stop at the water’s edge, an aphorism attributed to the late US Senator Arthur Vandenberg (R-MI), a former isolationist (until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor) who strongly supported President Harry Truman’s foreign policy to contain and counter Soviet Communism after World War II.\n\n“Vandenberg, a Michigan Republican who chaired the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, worked with the administration of Democratic President Harry Truman to forge a bipartisan consensus that included support for the Marshall Plan, NATO and the Truman Doctrine, which held that the U.S. would intervene when its allies were threatened,” [writes former US Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-IN)](https://news.iu.edu/hamiltonlugar/live/news/37191-hamilton-on-foreign-policy-249-should-politics), co-chair with former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean Sr. of the [9/11 Commission](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-911REPORT/context). “Those actions helped keep us safe and secure for generations.”\n\n> “…always remember to be a patriot ahead of being a partisan.”\n>\n> Former Canadian Conservative Leader and ex-Member of Parliament, Erin O’Toole\n\nOur nation’s elected officials, especially in Congress, have lost sight of that. Too many instinctively support or oppose policies, foreign or domestic, just because a certain President proposed them. It would also help if a certain President didn’t make everything about _him_, especially someone’s tragic death. A return to genuine humility in the public sphere would help.\n\nMaybe we should resolve also not to make everything about _us_.\n\n**Train Your Social Media Algorithms, and Limit Your Time**\n\nLet’s be real. Social media, especially X but also other sites, from Facebook to BlueSky, are homes to the Outrage Machine. We need not only to stop feeding it, but the good news is that we can train our social media feeds to at least quarantine what we see and engage with.\n\nLet’s define what we mean by “social media.” I don’t mean news (fake or otherwise) outlets, such as _Associated Press_ or the _Washington Examiner_. I’m talking about X, Facebook, Instagram, and a host of others that include Donald Trump’s Truth Social, GETTR, MeWe, The Babylon Bee’s Social Site, Parler, Mastadon, USA.Life, CloutHub, Meta’s Threads, and every lefty’s favorite, BlueSky. There are others, such as the evil Chinese Communist data collection and propaganda site, Tik Tok.\n\n[![May be an image of television, minions and text that says 'TAS ΑΤΑ.

Sixty percent of the world uses the social media. Some 150 million new users came on board in 2023, according to the Digital Marketing Institute. Like all new technology, it is both a curse and a blessing, a [yin and yang](https://www.thoughtco.com/yin-and-yang-629214), offering a wide panoply of benefits while introducing a bevy of new problems and issues, from from gifting us with the means to reconnect and share with old friends and democratizing the media to grifting with clickbait, exacerbating mental health challenges, and breeding toxic polarization.\n\nIt’s helpful to remember that most of these sites employ the use of algorithms, which the [Digital Marking Institute](https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/how-do-social-media-algorithms-work) (DMI) describes this way:\n\n> “An algorithm is a mathematical set of rules specifying how a group of data behaves. In social media, algorithms help maintain order and assist in ranking search results and advertisements. On Facebook, for example, there is an algorithm that directs pages and content to display in a certain order.”\n\nDMI also posts on [how to train your Facebook algorithms](https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/member-spotlight-10-engagement-hacks-for-the-facebook-algorithm-in-2020). Engagement hacks, they’re called. I understand now why my Facebook posts with links get shadow-banned - they want engagement, and don’t like it when you send readers to outside links like Substack. So, they limit who reads your posts with links. The same with political posts. That’s why many Facebook posters put their links in the comment section, to broaden their distribution. It also might help explain why your non-political, more personal posts win lot more engagement.\n\nThere are lots of other good ideas, too. Be sure to “like” and comment on other’s posts. Remember, they reward engagement and those who encourage people to stay on Facebook.\n\nX, the most toxic of our social media sites yet perhaps the most powerful (Facebook and its sister, Instagram, are close seconds, as is the evil Tik Tok), has a nifty feature at the top of your page or feed that allows you options on what you see and read, from “for you” to “following.” You can add communities of interest, such as “Election Integrity” to the “Nietzsche Society.” All these sites, including search engines, use AI, and X’s Grok is among the best (Google’s Gemini is perhaps the best at creating photos).\n\nI carefully curate what I follow to avoid the clickbait artists, right and left, with a focus on credible and thoughtful writers and posters. I try to avoid anonymous posters, since they’re the worst, but a few including @CynicalPublius, and @AGHamilton are incredibly interesting, often informative, and frequently insightful. Even then, the Outrage Machine is unavoidable, but at least I minimize it, and I treasure recommendations of thoughtful sites. I never leave the “following” feed on X. There’s way too much clickbait and outrage elsewhere that doesn’t interest me, and I find toxic, divisive, and harmful.\n\n**Remember: What gets rewarded gets repeated.**\n\nConcurrent with that, I highly recommend rediscovering _real books_ in 2026. I was struck the other day by how few people, especially younger generations, read books, whether old-fashioned hardback and paperback versions, or the audio and Kindle versions I migrate to (I find Kindle a remarkable resource, although I wish it would let me cut and paste quotes). Kindle books also take up less room to collect dust on my shelves and cost less. Although, I do like the bookcase in my office - it’s like a walk through time and bring up great memories. Bookcases tell a lot of about people, stories unto themselves.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_vS1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f448979-8579-4849-b7de-ba5b21095a1d_640x598.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_vS1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f448979-8579-4849-b7de-ba5b21095a1d_640x598.jpeg)\n\nWhile the “average” person reads or listens to 8 books a year, the “median” is closer to two. There are lots of voracious book readers out there who tilt the average, but even more people who never pick one up, driving down the median.\n\nIt may help explain our recent election outcomes, especially in New York, where are about to reminded that those who haven’t learn from history are about to repeat it.\n\n[![Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xtp-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe458dce7-7900-48f3-b42a-b0f9b9a98588_1252x1382.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xtp-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe458dce7-7900-48f3-b42a-b0f9b9a98588_1252x1382.jpeg)\n\nIn particular, I highly recommend a focus on books this year that will help you grow and learn. That includes everything from history to biographies and even historical fiction, a personal favorite genre of mine. Learning about other people through well-written biographies may take longer - Ron Chernow’s books on Ulysses Grant, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington are remarkable examples, and there are many, many others. Speaking of Grant, his autobiography remains a gold standard and a remarkable read.\n\nI personally like autobiographies, and migrate to those written by former and current US Senators with observations about institution, their lives, and political culture, since I’m largely a creature of that place. The most recent books include those by US Senators [James Lankford](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=turnaround+america%27s+revival\\&adgrpid=186061792683\\&hvadid=779752556291\\&hvdev=c\\&hvexpln=0\\&hvlocphy=9007567\\&hvnetw=g\\&hvocijid=17649378088385427727--\\&hvqmt=e\\&hvrand=17649378088385427727\\&hvtargid=kwd-2435442009354\\&hydadcr=22568_13821188_8365\\&mcid=2b54304ac84f34cbb7b3bf05ca5e5098\\&tag=googhydr-20\\&ref=pd_sl_60jagfavdr_e) (R-OK), and, one of my most recent reads, “_[How to Test Negative for Stupid](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=how+to+test+negative+for+stupid\\&crid=5B4YBZRVWAPI\\&sprefix=How+to+test+negi%2Caps%2C162\\&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-expert-pd-ops-ranker_1_16)_ _(and Why Washington Never Will)_” by John Kennedy (R-LA). Neither are “policy” books, although they touch on them, and Kennedy’s book in particular will have you rolling on the floor in laughter. I’m especially fond of audio books read by the author. I’ve never met Kennedy, but he clearly is one of a kind.\n\nHaving worked a couple of elections in Louisiana, I have warm spot in my heart for politicians from the Pelican State. They are generally street smart, clever, and fun to be around. Well, except one, who I had to confront in the 1990 US Senate election there and who Kennedy writes eloquently about in his book. There is no better inquisitor in a Senate hearing than Senator Kennedy. Example:\n\n{{youtube:s5Yg5k97bJk}}\n\nThere are plenty of great books out there, many of them recent, that will enlighten you in remarkable ways, from “_Fixing Congress: Restoring Power to the People_,” by my friends Mike Johnson (not the House Speaker) and Jerry Climer to “_Turning Small Talk into Big Talk_” by Jan Janura on the power of “table questions” during small group or family dinners and events. People still in the work force, whether in corporations or government entities, may find inspiration in my friend Ira Chaleff’s “_Courageous Follower_” or “_To Stop a Tyrant_.” While authors and books often focus on “leadership,” Ira is a pioneer in the lonely yet important field of “followership.”\n\nFor those looking to reengage in American history, I highly recommend Dr. Wilfred McClay’s “_Our Land of Hope_,” a wonderful, honest, inspiring, and accessible walk through our past 250 years. Since this is America’s 250th anniversary, what better time is there to listen or read this terrific tome. On the recommendation of my friend Hugh Hewitt, I’ll also be picking up Geoffrey Shepard’s “_The Nixon Conspiracy_,” since I’ve read nearly everything else on the one of the most consequential presidencies in American history, especially about the Watergate scandal. But first I have to finish another book co-authored by the late Bob Dove, who was Parliamentarian of the Senate, “_Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate._” Dove was a good friend and mentor during my days as Secretary of the Senate. The Senate’s filibuster is _important_.\n\nAlso, humility make you not only more interesting, but more interested in other people. Get to know some of your neighbors this year. Make a few new friends, and perhaps reconnect with ones you’ve lost touch with. At least try.\n\n**Deepen your Faith Journey**\n\nNearly every resolution I’ve recommended is rooted in the characteristics of a Christian life. Accountability. Authenticity. Charitable. Cautious. Dignified. Engaging. Ethical. And a word or characteristic that appears some 73 times in the Good Book: _Humility_.\n\nMany of our problems and issues may not find _solutions_ in our faith, but _a means to deal with them_. Anxiety melts away as we put things in perspective. Resolve to be genuinely humble in 2026, which means more curious, more respectful, more circumspect, and frankly, more enjoyable for other people to be around.\n\nResolve to deepen your faith journey in 2026, and the other resolutions will likely fall into place. If you’re looking for tools to help, let me suggest one: my friend Mark Strand, who also has a terrific Substack site, send an early morning email every day entitled a Daily Inspiration, with a couple of Bible verses and a few terrific quotes and practical advice. If interested, email Mark at <marknilstrand@gmail.com> and ask to be added to his mailing list. You won’t regret it.\n\n_Part IV will be my wish list for our policy makers in 2026._\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!84Wx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa8223fe-4807-4ba0-a85b-3f09674cda37_1248x1660.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!84Wx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa8223fe-4807-4ba0-a85b-3f09674cda37_1248x1660.png)",
