  "title": "Why \"High Resolution Conversations\"?",
  "preview": "I've been thinking about this for a while. Here's why I changed my publication's name.",
  "body": "Since joining Substack on December 19th of last year, I've wanted to explore the pitfalls in both online and face-to-face conversations, encouraging others to consider them.\n\nHowever, the name of my publication, “Gene’s Substack”, didn’t communicate this choice of topic; it just communicated that this publication belonged to me. I wanted to change the name, but I couldn’t think of one that I was comfortable with. I knew I wanted the idea of “conversations” to be in the title, but beyond that, nothing really seemed right.\n\nA few days ago, I thought about this again, and I realized that many of the ways I thought about conversations had analogies in the visual arts (drawing, painting, photography, etc.). We frequently talk about issues not being “black and white” or talk about how someone is “painting with a broad brush.” Beyond this, I thought about the differences between painting, photography, and raytracing and how each takes a different approach to visually communicating or representing reality.\n\nWhat helped me to decide on “High Resolution Conversations” was the fact that what I really want to communicate most is the need to represent others accurately and charitably. A higher resolution image takes much more time to render using a raytracer than a lower resolution image, yet at the same time, the details in the higher resolution image are clearer and the image looks more realistic. Similarly, representing others’ views accurately and charitably in conversation takes more time and effort, but the speaker or writer who goes that extra mile will likely have greater credibility with their audience.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QcgW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39ddf655-b1cc-4ce8-b9f5-271c85c924a7_1920x1080.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QcgW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39ddf655-b1cc-4ce8-b9f5-271c85c924a7_1920x1080.png)\n\n{{caption:1920x1080 image}}\n\nAnother thing I thought about later was the use of “resolution” in the term “conflict resolution”. Here again, accuracy and charity are key: it is far mare likely that conflicts are resolved when both parties in the conflict accurately and chariably represent each other’s views than when they do not. And even when conflicts cannot be fully resolved, the parties will likely have greater repect for one another, which is a big step.\n\nWhat are some ways that people can “increase the resolution” of their conversations?",
