  "body": "**TAKING MY DOG ON A SCENTVENTURE**\n\nBy Andy Bloch\\\nSherman Oaks, CA\n\n<gorooster@gmail.com>\n\n \n\n**Intro**\n\n \n\nI’ve been experimenting with some alternative strategies for walking my dog, *Nugget*. After all, even the happiest pups tend to get bored or anxious left to their own devices in the great outdoors of a neighborhood trot.\n\n \n\nSo, here’s a fun, timely tip, one that humans like – and dogs *love*:\n\n \n\n**A Dog's Nose Leads the Way**\n\n \n\nI let the little guy call the shots based on what smells are interesting to him. I call it a **Scentventure**—because for dogs, especially my dog, a nose-powered adventure gets him directly to his happy place.\n\n \n\n**What’s a Scentventure?**\n\n \n\nIt’s a walk where your dog gets to stop, sniff, and investigate every blade of grass – like a mini, four-legged detective. I liken it to a walk through a perfume museum, replacing French fragrances with squirrel trails and mystery pee.\n\n \n\nFor humans, it may not seem exciting—but for Nugget, it can be a\\*\\* canine Disneyland. When dogs sniff, they’re collecting stories. Hopefully, those stories become the theatre for their tranquil, post-walk dreams.\n\n \n\n**Why It’s Important**\n\n \n\nScentventures can be mentally enriching. A contented, tired puppy isn’t one who simply ran fast—it’s one who got to *think*, *explore*, and *sniff* along a grass path to their heart’s content.\n\n \n\nDog experts say that sniffing is proven to lower stress and boost confidence. It can also reduce unwanted behaviors like aggressive barking and chewing– the latter serves as a savior for pricey couches and rugs.\n\n \n\n**How to Start Your Scentventure**\n\n \n\n**Find the Best Leash**\\\nTry a 10- to 15-foot leash—not retractable, one that gives him a little freedom. You’re still in control, but your dog gets his space to roam.\n\n \n\n**Choose Spots Rich with Smell**\\\nDirt paths, grassy fields, parks, and tree and flower-lined sidewalks work nicely—anywhere with nature’s variety; preferably a locale where the star sniff is not a run-of-the-mill fire hydrant.\n\n \n\n**Lose the Schedule**\\\nThis is not a timed power walk. If your dog wants to sniff the same weeds for two minutes, let him, because there are no rules. This is integral to the bonding magic.\n\n \n\n**Keep it Going**\\\nA slim 10-15 minutes, a few times a week can make a big difference. The result should create a calmer, more fulfilled poochie. He’ll thank you later with lots of licks - as opposed to tearing up your shoes.\n\n \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n \n\nThis tried-and-true strategy proves a dog parent can lead by *not* leading. It allows your pet to follow his or her nose – aka their beacon to contentment. So - try a Scentventure and watch your pup light up like a bee in a patch of daisies. You’ll be glad you did, but not as glad as your pet.",
