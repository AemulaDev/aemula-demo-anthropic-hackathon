It didn’t sound like a crowd. It sounded like the substation across Route 234—one of the many nodes in the electrical lattice that keeps Northern Virginia’s data-center empire alive. People fanned themselves with folded agendas. The air was still, thick, electrically charged. And the hum kept going.\n\nA woman in a green raincoat stepped to the microphone. She lived near Pageland Lane, where developers wanted to convert 2,100 acres of farmland into what the Washington Post called “one of the largest data-center developments on Earth.” She didn’t raise her voice. She didn’t need to.\n\n“My bill went up again,” she said. “I used less electricity than last year. But I paid more. And no one will tell us exactly why.”\n\nThat line hung over the room. Later, she’d learn that she wasn’t imagining it. Dominion’s 2024 and 2025 rate filings attributed a meaningful share of their grid upgrades—including transmission-line expansions and new substations—to data-center growth. But here’s the twist the public rarely hears: that doesn’t mean data centers inherently raise everyone’s rates. Under the right conditions—when they soak up spare capacity and pay their full freight—large loads can actually push rates _down_ by spreading fixed costs across more kilowatt-hours.\n\nThe tension comes from the word “spare.”\n\nNorthern Virginia ran out of that years ago.\n\nThe hum deepened as the next speaker approached—a retired Army officer in a Prince William baseball cap. He pointed at the map of the Digital Gateway corridor and said, almost quietly at first, that the region was being asked to “overbuild the grid for companies that don’t live here.” The council members shifted. Several residents nodded.\n\nThen he added the line that sharpened the room:\n\n“If we don’t demand the right rules, the cost of this expansion gets smeared across everybody’s bill.”\n\nOnly after meeting him on the page does the next part land: **“We’re paying for growth we didn’t choose.”**\n\nThe hum rose just enough to feel it in the floor.\n\nWhat’s happening in Prince William is not isolated. The same tension is playing out in Georgia, where Georgia Power requested **$16 billion** in new generation—mostly to support data-center load. In Maryland and D.C., Pepco customers saw bills rise even as they used less electricity. People Magazine profiled a Baltimore woman who cut consumption but still saw a jump. The reason: her utility was rebuilding the grid to serve fast-growing, concentrated demand.\n\nBut the nuance matters. In Arizona, Oregon, parts of Texas, and the Midwest, data centers have actually helped stabilize rates. They bought into existing capacity. They didn’t trigger multi-billion-dollar expansions. Their load soaked up fixed costs.\n\nThat’s the deeper economic truth: **data centers don’t raise rates — expansion does.**\n\nExpansion that someone has to pay for.\n\nThe hum doesn’t tell you who.\n\nWhen you zoom out from these local fights, the national picture gets stranger. On the same morning Prince William residents were pleading for transparency, the Mag7—the index tracking the AI giants—jumped sharply. Not because anything changed in fundamentals. Not because wafer supply improved or new contracts materialized. But because Federal Reserve officials suggested rate cuts “might come sooner.”\n\nMarkets inhaled one sentence and exhaled billions.\n\nIf you listened closely on a trading floor that morning, you heard another hum—a nervous, caffeinated one. Chats pinging. Terminals glowing. Voices rising—not in panic, but in the peculiar optimism that follows Fed hints. A belief that the central bank can steady a sector whose assets age too fast for interest-rate magic to matter.\n\nHere’s the thing: the Fed can influence mortgages, long bonds, and recessions.\n\nWhat it cannot do is give a thirty-year life to a five-year GPU cluster.\n\nMeta depreciates its AI racks over roughly 5.5 years. Analysts like Kuppy Kupperman say three to ten years is now standard for AI physical plant. Data centers live fast and die faster. Rate cuts don’t transform fruit into stone.\n\nYet traders behave as if they do.\n\nThis distortion—markets treating short-lived assets like long-lived ones—is only half the story. The other half lives in the drag from the tariff war.\n\nSince Trump restarted his tariff machine in 2025—rewriting agreements, issuing midnight penalties, threatening new rounds with no warning—American manufacturing investment has seized up. Harvard Business School research shows tariff uncertainty doesn’t just discourage investment; it **kills** long-term planning. The Peterson Institute calls it “regulatory instability masquerading as economic strategy.”\n\nFactories paused expansion. Supply chains froze. Capital budgets shrank.\n\nAnd paradoxically, the AI boom masked all of it.\n\nWithout AI-related capex, business investment would likely be in outright contraction.\n\nThat’s not political framing. That’s the IMF’s own caution.\n\nTwo tugs.\n\nOne backward. One forward.\n\nOne clouding the other.\n\nIn the Prince William hearing room, the council members stared at the map again. Loudoun County—just up the road—already hosts the world’s densest cluster of data centers. WIRED described the skyline as “a thicket of windowless fortresses humming with servers.” Residents have filed noise complaints that read like diary entries: low-frequency rumble, constant vibration, the sense of pressure on your chest even with the windows closed. One man told Bloomberg, **“It never stops. Even inside the house.”**\n\nThat is hum as fact, not metaphor.\n\nBut in the Beltway several miles away, the Fed was trying to downplay comparisons to 1999. Powell said today’s AI giants have real earnings. Jefferson said leverage is contained. Analysts at BlackRock and FactSet pointed to real year-over-year revenue growth among the Mag7. And yet the Bank of England warned that U.S. tech valuations now look “comparable to the dot-com peak.” Albert Edwards scoffed into microphones, insisting Americans were “turning a deaf ear to warnings because they’re making too much money.”\n\nTwo sets of facts.\n\nTwo stories.\n\nOne hum underneath both.\n\nBecause the real conflict isn’t between optimism and pessimism. It’s between **a boom that accelerates faster than the grid can bear** and **a tariff regime that squeezes the industries that depend on that grid**. The public sees only the bills. The markets see only the charts. Each blinds the other.\n\nAnd that is how misperception becomes policy.\n\nWhen the Prince William supervisors finally approved the Digital Gateway rezoning after midnight, the room erupted. Some people cheered. Some shouted betrayal. Reporters typed until their fingers shook. The hum outside the building was louder than it had been at sunset.\n\nBy dawn, Wall Street had already moved on.\n\nThe Mag7 rose again on the strength of a phrase about inflation “easing meaningfully.”\n\nNot a policy change. Not a shift in fundamentals.\n\nA phrase.\n\nThe local stories were still unfolding: petitions, lawsuits, rate cases, planning commission memos, grid models, community meetings. The infrastructure kept humming. The bills kept rising or stabilizing depending on the ZIP code and the regulatory footnotes. The tariffs kept freezing capital. The AI boom kept overheating data centers. The markets kept telling themselves the Fed could reconcile incompatible forces.\n\nBut the hum doesn’t lie.\n\nBecause when the two tugs tearing at the 2025 economy finally resolve—when tariff paralysis meets AI acceleration at the point where capital and infrastructure collide—the decisive moment won’t happen on CNBC or in a Fed Q\\&A.\n\nIt will happen in rooms like this one: fluorescent-lit, overheated, vibrating slightly as the grid strains against demand that outran planning. Rooms where residents ask why they are paying for someone else’s expansion. Rooms where the country discovers that the two forces pulling at its economy are not canceling out at all, but snapping it in two directions at once.\n\nAnd at the end, when the lights go out and the chairs scrape across the tile and the last reporter packs up her bag, the hum will still be there.\n\nQuiet.\n\nPersistent.\n\nUnavoidable.\n\nA reminder that belief can move markets, but infrastructure moves bills.\n\nAnd the math, eventually, moves everything else.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBibliography\n\n1\\.
