  "body": "As I was scrolling Facebook earlier today, I saw a post by my sister, Beth Jones, that listed news sources that identified biases and blind spots in current media coverage. I tried sharing her post on Facebook, but when doing so, it only shared the image from the same news source she shared and omitted what she had written on unbiased media sources.\n\nAs such, I wanted to write a post on Substack which would provide the sources she mentioned. I recommend all of them as well.\n\n### Straight Arrow News\n\nWebsite: <https://www.san.com>\n\nYouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/@StraightArrowNews>\n\nStraight Arrow News provides news coverage similar to CNN, MSNOW, or FOX (i.e., TV news broadcasts), but they also take into account media bias in their coverage through their “Unbiased Updates” (news without additional opinion), and “Media Misses” (stories not covered by one side or the other).\n\nBeth introduced Straight Arrow News to us (my parents and I) over Thanksgiving and I was impressed by the commitment to identifying and accounting for biases in media coverage. The host of the program that discussed media biases was fair and acknowledged that newsrooms have many factors to consider when deciding what to cover, which results in some stories not getting airtime on certain channels.\n\n### AllSides\n\nWebsite: <https://www.allsides.com>\n\nAllSides is a great source for identifying media bias in news stories. They provide news from across the political spectrum, and for stories that are covered by left, right, and center, they provide links to coverage from representative outlets from each. Additionally, they explain their media bias ratings as well as their methodology for determining bias, which appears reasonable and sound.\n\nInterestingly enough, I found an article from _Christianity Today_ that was classified as “Center”, which surprised me; I would have expected _Christianity Today_ to be classified as “Right”. All the same, I think it’s good that they are included in the considerations of bias.\n\n### Ground News\n\nWebsite: <https://ground.news>\n\nLike AllSides, Ground News is a great source for identifying media bias in news stories. They also have a “Blindspot” feature similar to Straight Arrow News’ “Media Miss” feature, which identifies stories covered by one side but not the other. Also, they have a “My News Bias” feature which looks like it shows me my own bias in reading news articles. I haven’t tried this yet, but it looks interesting.\n\nAre there other sites out there that are similar to these? Let me know!",
