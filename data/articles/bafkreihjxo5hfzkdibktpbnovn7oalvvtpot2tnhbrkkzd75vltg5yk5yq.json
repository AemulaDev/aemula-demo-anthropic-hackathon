  "preview": "No, women should not be worried.",
  "body": "Since I’ve had several people now reach out to me to ask about the SAVE Act (H.R. 22), I decided to write about it. I’ll break it down by section. For all the gory policy details, read to the end. For everyone else, I’ve dropped a two-paragraph TL;DR below.\n\n***\n\n_**TL;DR Version:**_ This bill only applies to **voters registered after its passage.** If you are already registered to vote and you are not moving to a new state, nothing will change for you. _**If you are a new voter, you will need to provide a REAL ID that shows your birthplace or immigration status, a passport, a state- or tribe-issued ID showing your birthplace or citizenship, or a state- or tribe-issued ID that does not show your birthplace or immigration status, and your birth certificate.**_\n\nThe only circumstance in which a woman will need her marriage certificate or other name-change documentation is if she is not currently registered to vote in her state, has gotten married, does not have a REAL ID or state-issued ID that shows immigration/citizenship status or birthplace, does not have a passport, and has changed her name between birth and her current ID. In that limited scenario, then a woman will need documentation of the name change that connects her current name to her birth certificate. _**This is most likely, statistically, to impact young Republican women.**_\n\n***\n\nFirst, you should know that “shall” and “must” are key words in policy that mean the following instruction(s) is a **requirement or obligation.** On the other hand, **may** is a key word that means the following instruction(s) is **suggested or optional, not required.**\n\nI always recommend people begin at [the source](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/22/text). H.R. 22 (House Resolution 22), also known as the SAVE Act, amends the [1993 Voter Registration Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false\\&edition=prelim\\&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title52-section20502\\&num=0\\&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjUyIHNlY3Rpb246MjA1MDggZWRpdGlvbjpwcmVsaW0p%7C%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim) to require proof of citizenship when registering a person to vote “in elections for Federal office, and for other purposes.”\n\nWith amendments, the changes to the 1993 Voter Registration Act are as follows (**Bold** indicates section headings, _italics_ indicate new text, and strikethrough indicates removed text):\n\n> **§20502. Definitions**\n>\n> (a) In general.—As used in this chapter-\n>\n> (1) the term \"election\" has the meaning stated in section 30101(1) of this title;\n>\n> (2) the term \"Federal office\" has the meaning stated in section 30101(3) of this title;\n>\n> (3) the term \"motor vehicle driver's license\" includes any personal identification document issued by a State motor vehicle authority;\n>\n> (4) the term \"State\" means a State of the United States and the District of Columbia; and\n>\n> (5) the term \"voter registration agency\" means an office designated under section 20506(a)(1) of this title to perform voter registration activities. ( Pub. L. 103–31, §3, May 20, 1993, 107 Stat. 77 .)\n>\n> _(b) Documentary proof of United States citizenship.—As used in this Act, the term ‘documentary proof of United States citizenship’ means, with respect to an applicant for voter registration, any of the following:_\n>\n> _(1) A form of identification issued consistent with the requirements of the REAL ID Act of 2005 that indicates the applicant is a citizen of the United States._\n>\n> _(2) A valid United States passport._\n>\n> _(3) The applicant's official United States military identification card, together with a United States military record of service showing that the applicant's place of birth was in the United States._\n>\n> _(4) A valid government-issued photo identification card issued by a Federal, State or Tribal government showing that the applicant’s place of birth was in the United States._\n>\n> _(5) A valid government-issued photo identification card issued by a Federal, State or Tribal government other than an identification described in paragraphs (1) through (4), but only if presented together with one or more of the following:_\n>\n> _(A) A certified birth certificate issued by a State, a unit of local government in a State, or a Tribal government which—_\n>\n> _(i) was issued by the State, unit of local government, or Tribal government in which the applicant was born;_\n>\n> _(ii) was filed with the office responsible for keeping vital records in the State;_\n>\n> _(iii) includes the full name, date of birth, and place of birth of the applicant;_\n>\n> _(iv) lists the full names of one or both of the parents of the applicant;_\n>\n> _(v) has the signature of an individual who is authorized to sign birth certificates on behalf of the State, unit of local government, or Tribal government in which the applicant was born;_\n>\n> _(vi) includes the date that the certificate was filed with the office responsible for keeping vital records in the State; and_\n>\n> _(vii) has the seal of the State, unit of local government, or Tribal government that issued the birth certificate._\n>\n> _(B) An extract from a United States hospital Record of Birth created at the time of the applicant's birth which indicates that the applicant’s place of birth was in the United States._\n>\n> _(C) A final adoption decree showing the applicant’s name and that the applicant’s place of birth was in the United States._\n>\n> _(D) A Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a citizen of the United States or a certification of the applicant’s Report of Birth of a United States citizen issued by the Secretary of State._\n>\n> _(E) A Naturalization Certificate or Certificate of Citizenship issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security or any other document or method of proof of United States citizenship issued by the Federal government pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act._\n>\n> _(F) An American Indian Card issued by the Department of Homeland Security with the classification ‘KIC’._\n\nIn this first section, Congress defines the terms that will be important throughout the Act. When looking at phrases, you need to apply the definitions listed instead of dictionary definitions, legal definitions, or your own assumptions.\n\nHere, the most important thing being defined is “Documentary proof of United States citizenship.**” This is the documentation that people will be required to provide, and states will be required to review only at the time of voter registration.**\n\nIdentification types 1, 2, and 4 can be used to establish citizenship without any additional documentation.\n\nIdentification type 3 can be used when shown alongside at least one additional document: “a United States military record of service showing that the applicant's place of birth was in the United States.”\n\nIdentification type 5 can be used when shown alongside at least one of the documents listed in 5(A) through 5(F).\n\n> **§20503. National procedures for voter registration for elections for Federal office**\n>\n> (a) In general\n>\n> Except as provided in subsection (b), notwithstanding any other Federal or State law, in addition to any other method of voter registration provided for under State law, each State shall establish procedures to register to vote in elections for Federal office-\n>\n> (1) by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver's license pursuant to section 20504 of this title;\n>\n> (2) by mail application pursuant to section 20505 of this title; and\n>\n> (3) by application in person-\n>\n> (A) at the appropriate registration site designated with respect to the residence of the applicant in accordance with State law; and\n>\n> (B) at a Federal, State, or nongovernmental office designated under section 20506 of this title.\n>\n> (~~cb~~) Nonapplicability to certain States\n>\n> _Except with respect to the requirements under subsection (i) and (j) of section 8 in the case of a State described in paragraph (2),_ this chapter does not apply to a State described in either or both of the following paragraphs:\n>\n> (1) A State in which, under law that is in effect continuously on and after August 1, 1994, there is no voter registration requirement for any voter in the State with respect to an election for Federal office.\n>\n> (2) A State in which, under law that is in effect continuously on and after August 1, 1994, or that was enacted on or prior to August 1, 1994, and by its terms is to come into effect upon the enactment of this chapter, so long as that law remains in effect, all voters in the State may register to vote at the polling place at the time of voting in a general election for Federal office.\n>\n> _(c) Permitting States To adopt certain requirements after enactment._\n>\n> *Subsections (i) and (j) of section 8 shall not apply to a State described in subsection* (_~~cb~~)(2) if the State, by law or regulation, adopts requirements which are identical to the requirements under such subsections not later than 60 days prior to the date of the first election for Federal office which is held in the State after the date of the enactment of the SAVE Act._\n\nThis section is about exceptions to the SAVE Act. It says that North Dakota (the state without voter registration!) does not need to follow the SAVE Act (It couldn’t; it doesn’t register voters.) but all other states do.\n\n> **§20504. Simultaneous application for voter registration and application for motor vehicle driver's license**\n>\n> (a) In general\n>\n> (1) _Subject to the requirements under section 8(j)_, each State motor vehicle driver's license application (including any renewal application) submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority under State law shall serve as an application for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office unless the applicant fails to sign the voter registration application.\n>\n> (2) An application for voter registration submitted under paragraph (1) shall be considered as updating any previous voter registration by the applicant.\n>\n> ~~(b) Limitation on use of information~~\n>\n> ~~No information relating to the failure of an applicant for a State motor vehicle driver's license to sign a voter registration application may be used for any purpose other than voter registration.~~\n>\n> _(b) Requiring applicants to present documentary proof of United States citizenship.—Under any method of voter registration in a State, the State shall not accept and process an application to register to vote in an election for Federal office unless the applicant presents documentary proof of United States citizenship with the application._\n>\n> (c) Forms and procedures\n>\n> (1) _Subject to the requirements under section 8(j)_, each State shall include a voter registration application form for elections for Federal office as part of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license.\n>\n> (2) The voter registration application portion of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license-\n>\n> (A) may not require any information that duplicates information required in the driver's license portion of the form (other than a second signature or other information necessary under subparagraph (C));\n>\n> (B) may require only the minimum amount of information necessary to-\n>\n> (i) prevent duplicate voter registrations; and\n>\n> (ii) enable State election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process; _and_\n>\n> _(iii) verify that the applicant is a citizen of the United States;_\n>\n> (C) shall include a statement that-\n>\n> (i) states each eligibility requirement (including citizenship) _including the requirement that the applicant provides documentary proof of United States citizenship_;\n>\n> (ii) contains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and\n>\n> (iii) requires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury;\n>\n> (D) shall include, in print that is identical to that used in the attestation portion of the application-\n>\n> (i) the information required in section 20507(a)(5)(A) and (B) of this title;\n>\n> (ii) a statement that, if an applicant declines to register to vote, the fact that the applicant has declined to register will remain confidential and will be used only for voter registration purposes; and\n>\n> (iii) a statement that if an applicant does register to vote, the office at which the applicant submits a voter registration application will remain confidential and will be used only for voter registration purposes; and other than as evidence in a criminal proceeding or immigration proceeding brought against an applicant who knowingly attempts to register to vote and knowingly makes a false declaration under penalty of perjury that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements to register to vote in an election for Federal office; and\n>\n> (E) shall be made available (as submitted by the applicant, or in machine readable or other format) to the appropriate State election official as provided by State law.\n>\n> (d) Change of address\n>\n> Any change of address form submitted in accordance with State law for purposes of a State motor vehicle driver's license shall serve as notification of change of address for voter registration with respect to elections for Federal office for the registrant involved unless the registrant states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.\n>\n> (e) Transmittal deadline\n>\n> (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a completed voter registration portion of an application for a State motor vehicle driver's license accepted at a State motor vehicle authority shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 days after the date of acceptance.\n>\n> (2) If a registration application is accepted within 5 days before the last day for registration to vote in an election, the application shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 5 days after the date of acceptance.\n\nThis section establishes the process by which an official shall receive and review documentation of citizenship prior to voter registration. The SAVE Act did not change this section except to require that voter registration applicants must provide documentary proof of citizenship.\n\n> **§20505. Mail registration**\n>\n> (a) Form\n>\n> (1) _Subject to the requirements under section 8(j)_, each State shall accept and use the mail voter registration application form prescribed by the ~~Federal Election Commission~~ *Election Assistance Commission* pursuant to section 20508(a)(2) of this title \\[motor vehicle driver’s license application] for the registration of voters in elections for Federal office.\n>\n> (2) In addition to accepting and using the form described in paragraph (1), a State may develop and use a mail voter registration form that meets all of the criteria stated in section 20508(b) of this title for the registration of voters in elections for Federal office.\n>\n> (3) A form described in paragraph (1) or (2) shall be accepted and used for notification of a registrant's change of address.\n>\n> (b) Availability of forms\n>\n> The chief State election official of a State shall make the forms described in subsection (a) available for distribution through governmental and private entities, with particular emphasis on making them available for organized voter registration programs. _The chief State election official of a State shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that residents of the State are aware of the requirement to provide documentary proof of United States citizenship to register to vote in elections for Federal office in the State._\n>\n> (c) First-time voters\n>\n> (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a State may by law require a person to vote in person if-\n>\n> (A) the person was registered to vote in a jurisdiction by mail; and\n>\n> (B) the person has not previously voted in that jurisdiction. _and the person did not provide documentary proof of United States citizenship when registering to vote._\n>\n> (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of a person-\n>\n> (A) who is entitled to vote by absentee ballot under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act \\[52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq.];\n>\n> (B) who is provided the right to vote otherwise than in person under section 20102(b)(2)(B)(ii) of this title; or\n>\n> (C) who is entitled to vote otherwise than in person under any other Federal law.\n>\n> (d) Undelivered notices\n>\n> If a notice of the disposition of a mail voter registration application under section 20507(a)(2) of this title is sent by nonforwardable mail and is returned undelivered, the registrar may proceed in accordance with section 20507(d) of this title.\n>\n> _(e) Ensuring proof of United States citizenship.—_\n>\n> _(1) PRESENTING PROOF OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO ELECTION OFFICIAL.—An applicant who submits the mail voter registration application form prescribed by the Election Assistance Commission pursuant to section 9(a)(2) or a form described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) shall not be registered to vote in an election for Federal office unless—_\n>\n> _(A) the applicant presents documentary proof of United States citizenship in person to the office of the appropriate election official not later than the deadline provided by State law for the receipt of a completed voter registration application for the election; or_\n>\n> _(B) in the case of a State which permits an individual to register to vote in an election for Federal office at a polling place on the day of the election and on any day when voting, including early voting, is permitted for the election, the applicant presents documentary proof of United States citizenship to the appropriate election official at the polling place not later than the date of the election._\n>\n> _(2) NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT.—Upon receiving an otherwise completed mail voter registration application form prescribed by the Election Assistance Commission pursuant to section 9(a)(2) or a form described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), the appropriate election official shall transmit a notice to the applicant of the requirement to present documentary proof of United States citizenship under this subsection, and shall include in the notice instructions to enable the applicant to meet the requirement._\n>\n> _(3) ACCESSIBILITY.—Each State shall, in consultation with the Election Assistance Commission, ensure that reasonable accommodations are made to allow an individual with a disability who submits the mail voter registration application form prescribed by the Election Assistance Commission pursuant to section 9(a)(2) or a form described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) to present documentary proof of United States citizenship to the appropriate election official._\n\nThis section is about how and when an election official must receive documentary proof of citizenship when registering a new voter. In short, all documentary evidence of citizenship must be provided and reviewed in person (except from voters with disability accommodations and voters with overseas service exemptions) before a new voter applicant can cast a ballot.\n\n**If a state legislature so chooses**, it may by law require a person who is registered to vote in a jurisdiction but has never previously voted in that jurisdiction and did not provide proof of citizenship at registration to vote in person. There shall be accommodations for people with disabilities and overseas/uniformed service members exceptions. As far as I know, no state legislature has done this yet.\n\nFinally, “The chief State election official of a State shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that residents of the State are aware of the requirement to provide documentary proof of United States citizenship to register to vote in elections for Federal office in the State.”\n\n> **§20506. Voter registration agencies**\n>\n> (a) Designation\n>\n> (1) Each State shall designate agencies for the registration of voters in elections for Federal office.\n>\n> (2) Each State shall designate as voter registration agencies-\n>\n> (A) all offices in the State that provide public assistance; and\n>\n> (B) all offices in the State that provide State-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\n>\n> (3)\n>\n> (A) In addition to voter registration agencies designated under paragraph (2), each State shall designate other offices within the State as voter registration agencies.\n>\n> (B) Voter registration agencies designated under subparagraph (A) may include-\n>\n> (i) State or local government offices such as public libraries, public schools, offices of city and county clerks (including marriage license bureaus), fishing and hunting license bureaus, government revenue offices, unemployment compensation offices, and offices not described in paragraph (2)(B) that provide services to persons with disabilities; and\n>\n> (ii) Federal and nongovernmental offices, with the agreement of such offices.\n>\n> (4)\n>\n> (A) At each voter registration agency, the following services shall be made available:\n>\n> (i) Distribution of mail voter registration application forms in accordance with paragraph (6).\n>\n> (ii) Assistance to applicants in completing voter registration application forms, unless the applicant refuses such assistance.\n>\n> (iii) Acceptance of completed voter registration application forms for transmittal to the appropriate State election official.\n>\n> _(iv) Receipt of documentary proof of United States citizenship of each applicant to register to vote in elections for Federal office in the State._\n>\n> (B) If a voter registration agency designated under paragraph (2)(B) provides services to a person with a disability at the person's home, the agency shall provide the services described in subparagraph (A) at the person's home.\n>\n> (5) A person who provides service described in paragraph (4) shall not-\n>\n> (A) seek to influence an applicant's political preference or party registration;\n>\n> (B) display any such political preference or party allegiance;\n>\n> (C) make any statement to an applicant or take any action the purpose or effect of which is to discourage the applicant from registering to vote; or\n>\n> (D) make any statement to an applicant or take any action the purpose or effect of which is to lead the applicant to believe that a decision to register or not to register has any bearing on the availability of services or benefits.\n>\n> (6) A voter registration agency that is an office that provides service or assistance in addition to conducting voter registration shall-\n>\n> (A) distribute with each application for such service or assistance, and with each recertification, renewal, or change of address form relating to such service or assistance-\n>\n> (i) the mail voter registration application form described in section 20508(a)(2) of this title, including a statement that-\n>\n> (I) specifies each eligibility requirement ~~(including citizenship)~~ _including the requirement that the applicant provides documentary proof of United States citizenship_;\n>\n> (II) contains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and\n>\n> (III) requires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury; or\n>\n> (ii) the office's own form if it is equivalent to the form described in section 20508(a)(2) of this title, unless the applicant, in writing, declines to register to vote;\n>\n> _(B) ask the applicant the question, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States?’ and if the applicant answers in the affirmative require documentary proof of United States citizenship prior to providing the form under subparagraph (C);_\n>\n> (_C_) provide a form that includes-\n>\n> (i) the question, \"If you are not registered to vote where you live now, would you like to apply to register to vote here today?\";\n>\n> (ii) if the agency provides public assistance, the statement, \"Applying to register or declining to register to vote will not affect the amount of assistance that you will be provided by this agency.\";\n>\n> (iii) boxes for the applicant to check to indicate whether the applicant would like to register or declines to register to vote (failure to check either box being deemed to constitute a declination to register for purposes of subparagraph (C)), together with the statement (in close proximity to the boxes and in prominent type), \"IF YOU DO NOT CHECK EITHER BOX, YOU WILL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THIS TIME.\";\n>\n> (iv) the statement, \"If you would like help in filling out the voter registration application form, we will help you. The decision whether to seek or accept help is yours. You may fill out the application form in private.\"; and\n>\n> (v) the statement, \"If you believe that someone has interfered with your right to register or to decline to register to vote, your right to privacy in deciding whether to register or in applying to register to vote, or your right to choose your own political party or other political preference, you may file a complaint with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\", the blank being filled by the name, address, and telephone number of the appropriate official to whom such a complaint should be addressed; and\n>\n> (C) provide to each applicant who does not decline to register to vote the same degree of assistance with regard to the completion of the registration application form as is provided by the office with regard to the completion of its own forms, unless the applicant refuses such assistance.\n>\n> (7) No information relating to a declination to register to vote in connection with an application made at an office described in paragraph (6) may be used for any purpose other than voter registration.\n>\n> (b) Federal Government and private sector cooperation\n>\n> All departments, agencies, and other entities of the executive branch of the Federal Government shall, to the greatest extent practicable, cooperate with the States in carrying out subsection (a), and all nongovernmental entities are encouraged to do so.\n>\n> (c) Armed Forces recruitment offices\n>\n> (1) Each State and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly develop and implement procedures for persons _who are citizens of the United States_ to apply to register to vote at recruitment offices of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n>\n> (2) A recruitment office of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be considered to be a voter registration agency designated under subsection (a)(2) for all purposes of this chapter.\n>\n> (d) Transmittal deadline\n>\n> (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a completed registration application accepted at a voter registration agency shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 10 days after the date of acceptance.\n>\n> (2) If a registration application is accepted within 5 days before the last day for registration to vote in an election, the application shall be transmitted to the appropriate State election official not later than 5 days after the date of acceptance.\n\nThis just says that voter registration for federal elections must now include a check box on the form to verify the applicant provided documentary proof of citizenship at the time of registration.\n\n> **§20507. Requirements with respect to administration of voter registration**\n>\n> (a) In general\n>\n> _Subject to the requirements of subsection (j),_ in the administration of voter registration for elections for Federal office, each State shall-\n>\n> (1) ensure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election-\n>\n> (A) in the case of registration with a motor vehicle application under section 20504 of this title, if the valid voter registration form of the applicant is submitted to the appropriate State motor vehicle authority not later than the lesser of 30 days, or the period provided by State law, before the date of the election;\n>\n> (B) in the case of registration by mail under section 20505 of this title, if the valid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked not later than the lesser of 30 days, or the period provided by State law, before the date of the election;\n>\n> (C) in the case of registration at a voter registration agency, if the valid voter registration form of the applicant is accepted at the voter registration agency not later than the lesser of 30 days, or the period provided by State law, before the date of the election;

and\n>\n> (2) shall not result in the removal of the name of any person from the official list of voters registered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote, except that nothing in this paragraph may be construed to prohibit a State from using the procedures described in subsections (c) and (d) to remove an individual from the official list of eligible voters if the individual-\n>\n> (A) has not either notified the applicable registrar (in person or in writing) or responded during the period described in subparagraph (B) to the notice sent by the applicable registrar;

or\n>\n> (ii) the registrant has moved to a different residence address not in the same registrar's jurisdiction, the registrar uses the notice procedure described in subsection (d)(2) to confirm the change of address.\n>\n> (2)\n>\n> (A) A State shall complete, not later than 90 days prior to the date of a primary or general election for Federal office, any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.\n>\n> (B) Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to preclude-\n>\n> (i) the removal of names from official lists of voters on a basis described in paragraph (3)(A) or (B) or (4)(A) _or (C)_ of subsection (a);

and\n>\n> (E) the sentence imposed by the court.\n>\n> (3) On request of the chief State election official of a State or other State official with responsibility for determining the effect that a conviction may have on an offender's qualification to vote, the United States attorney shall provide such additional information as the United States attorney may have concerning the offender and the offense of which the offender was convicted.\n>\n> (4) If a conviction of which notice was given pursuant to paragraph (1) is overturned, the United States attorney shall give the official to whom the notice was given written notice of the vacation of the judgment.\n>\n> (5) The chief State election official shall notify the voter registration officials of the local jurisdiction in which an offender resides of the information received under this subsection.\n>\n> (h) Omitted\n>\n> (i) Public disclosure of voter registration activities\n>\n> (1) Each State shall maintain for at least 2 years and shall make available for public inspection and, where available, photocopying at a reasonable cost, all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters, except to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register to vote or to the identity of a voter registration agency through which any particular voter is registered.\n>\n> (2) The records maintained pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include lists of the names and addresses of all persons to whom notices described in subsection (d)(2) are sent, and information concerning whether or not each such person has responded to the notice as of the date that inspection of the records is made.\n>\n> _(j) Ensuring only citizens are registered To vote.—_\n>\n> _(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a State may not register an individual to vote in elections for Federal office held in the State unless, at the time the individual applies to register to vote, the individual provides documentary proof of United States citizenship._\n>\n> _(2) ADDITIONAL PROCESSES IN CERTAIN CASES.—_\n>\n> _(A) PROCESS FOR THOSE WITHOUT DOCUMENTARY PROOF.—_\n>\n> _(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to any relevant guidance adopted by the Election Assistance Commission, each State shall establish a process under which an applicant who cannot provide documentary proof of United States citizenship under paragraph (1) may, if the applicant signs an attestation under penalty of perjury that the applicant is a citizen of the United States and eligible to vote in elections for Federal office, submit such other evidence to the appropriate State or local official demonstrating that the applicant is a citizen of the United States and such official shall make a determination as to whether the applicant has sufficiently established United States citizenship for purposes of registering to vote in elections for Federal office in the State._\n>\n> _(ii) AFFIDAVIT REQUIREMENT.—If a State or local official makes a determination under clause (i) that an applicant has sufficiently established United States citizenship for purposes of registering to vote in elections for Federal office in the State, such determination shall be accompanied by an affidavit developed under clause (iii) signed by the official swearing or affirming the applicant sufficiently established United States citizenship for purposes of registering to vote._\n>\n> _(iii) DEVELOPMENT OF AFFIDAVIT BY THE ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION.—The Election Assistance Commission shall develop a uniform affidavit for use by State and local officials under clause (ii), which shall—_\n>\n> _(I) include an explanation of the minimum standards required for a State or local official to register an applicant who cannot provide documentary proof of United States citizenship to vote in elections for Federal office in the State; and_\n>\n> _(II) require the official to explain the basis for registering such applicant to vote in such elections._\n>\n> _(B) PROCESS IN CASE OF CERTAIN DISCREPANCIES IN DOCUMENTATION.—Subject to any relevant guidance adopted by the Election Assistance Commission, each State shall establish a process under which an applicant can provide such additional documentation to the appropriate election official of the State as may be necessary to establish that the applicant is a citizen of the United States in the event of a discrepancy with respect to the applicant’s documentary proof of United States citizenship._\n>\n> _(3) STATE REQUIREMENTS.—Each State shall take affirmative steps on an ongoing basis to ensure that only United States citizens are registered to vote under the provisions of this Act, which shall include the establishment of a program described in paragraph (4) not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection._\n>\n> _(4) PROGRAM DESCRIBED.—A State may meet the requirements of paragraph (3) by establishing a program under which the State identifies individuals who are not United States citizens using information supplied by one or more of the following sources:_\n>\n> _(A) The Department of Homeland Security through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (‘SAVE’) or otherwise._\n>\n> _(B) The Social Security Administration through the Social Security Number Verification Service, or otherwise._\n>\n> _(C) State agencies that supply State identification cards or driver’s licenses where the agency confirms the United States citizenship status of applicants._\n>\n> _(D) Other sources, including databases, which provide confirmation of United States citizenship status._\n>\n> _(5) AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.—_\n>\n> _(A) IN GENERAL.—At the request of a State election official (including a request related to a process established by a State under paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B)), any head of a Federal department or agency possessing information relevant to determining the eligibility of an individual to vote in elections for Federal office shall, not later than 24 hours after receipt of such request, provide the official with such information as may be necessary to enable the official to verify that an applicant for voter registration in elections for Federal office held in the State or a registrant on the official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office held in the State is a citizen of the United States, which shall include providing the official with such batched information as may be requested by the official._\n>\n> _(B) USE OF SAVE SYSTEM.—The Secretary of Homeland Security may respond to a request received under paragraph (1) by using the system for the verification of immigration status under the applicable provisions of section 1137 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b–7), as established pursuant to section 121(c) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–603)._\n>\n> _(C) SHARING OF INFORMATION.—The heads of Federal departments and agencies shall share information with each other with respect to an individual who is the subject of a request received under paragraph (A) in order to enable them to respond to the request._\n>\n> _(D) INVESTIGATION FOR PURPOSES OF REMOVAL.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall conduct an investigation to determine whether to initiate removal proceedings under section 239 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229) if it is determined pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) that an alien (as such term is defined in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101)) is unlawfully registered to vote in elections for Federal office._\n>\n> _(E) PROHIBITING FEES.—The head of a Federal department or agency may not charge a fee for responding to a State’s request under paragraph (A)._\n>\n> _(k) Removal of noncitizens from registration rolls.—A State shall remove an individual who is not a citizen of the United States from the official list of eligible voters for elections for Federal office held in the State at any time upon receipt of documentation or verified information that a registrant is not a United States citizen._\n>\n> (_l_) \"Registrar's jurisdiction\" defined\n>\n> For the purposes of this section, the term \"registrar's jurisdiction\" means-\n>\n> (1) an incorporated city, town, borough, or other form of municipality;\n>\n> (2) if voter registration is maintained by a county, parish, or other unit of government that governs a larger geographic area than a municipality, the geographic area governed by that unit of government; or\n>\n> (3) if voter registration is maintained on a consolidated basis for more than one municipality or other unit of government by an office that performs all of the functions of a voting registrar, the geographic area of the consolidated municipalities or other geographic units.\n\nThe first part of this subsection is very straightforward: It says that state election officials can remove a registered voter from the rolls “based on documentary proof or verified information that the registrant is not a United States citizen; or” if “the registration otherwise fails to comply with applicable State law\\[.]”\n\nSub-sub section (j) and (k) are more complicated and new and cited throughout the act. This is the bulk of the actual law.\n\nFirst, the SAVE Act declares that states may not register anyone to vote in federal elections without that person providing “documentary proof of citizenship.” The definition of that phrase comes from the very first section of the Act that we reviewed. **You should notice that this does not apply to people who are already registered voters, only to new voters.**\n\n**Second, each state must develop a process for someone who does not have documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote anyway.** They must attest under penalty of perjury with their signature that they are a citizen, and a state or local election official must attest the voter registration applicant has provided proof sufficient for that official. The Election Assistance Commission, a bipartisan independent government agency, will develop a national affidavit so the evidentiary burden of proof will be the same in every state.\n\n**Third, if there are discrepancies in the documentary evidence a person provides, the Election Assistance Commission will prescribe a process for resolving them.**\n\n**Fourth, within 30 days of passage of the SAVE Act, states must develop a program to affirmatively review voters registered pursuant to the SAVE Act that will validate citizenship claims.** The program may use at least one of the following to meet SAVE Act requirements: The Department of Homeland Security through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (‘SAVE’), the Social Security Administration through the Social Security Number Verification Service, State agencies that supply State identification cards or driver’s licenses where the agency confirms the United States citizenship status of applicants, or other sources, including databases, which provide confirmation of United States citizenship status.\n\n**Fifth, if a state determines an alien is illegally registered to vote, DHS will launch an investigation to determine whether the alien should be deported.**\n\n**Sixth, if a state receives “verified information” or “documentary evidence” that anyone registered to vote is not a citizen, that person shall be removed from the state’s voter rolls.**\n\n> **§20508. Federal coordination and regulations**\n>\n> (a) In general\n>\n> The Election Assistance Commission-\n>\n> (1) in consultation with the chief election officers of the States, shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out paragraphs (2) and (3);\n>\n> (2) in consultation with the chief election officers of the States, shall develop a mail voter registration application form for elections for Federal office;\n>\n> (3) not later than June 30 of each odd-numbered year, shall submit to the Congress a report assessing the impact of this chapter on the administration of elections for Federal office during the preceding 2-year period and including recommendations for improvements in Federal and State procedures, forms, and other matters affected by this chapter; and\n>\n> (4) shall provide information to the States with respect to the responsibilities of the States under this chapter.\n>\n> (b) Contents of mail voter registration form\n>\n> The mail voter registration form developed under subsection (a)(2)-\n>\n> (1) may require only such identifying information (including the signature of the applicant) and other information (including data relating to previous registration by the applicant), as is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process;\n>\n> (2) shall include a statement that-\n>\n> (A) specifies each eligibility requirement (~~including citizenship~~ *an explanation of what is required to present documentary proof of United States citizenship*);\n>\n> (B) contains an attestation that the applicant meets each such requirement; and\n>\n> (C) requires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury;\n>\n> (3) may not include any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication; and\n>\n> (4) shall include, in print that is identical to that used in the attestation portion of the application- _and_\n>\n> (~~i~~A) the information required in section 20507(a)(5)(A) and (B) of this title;\n>\n> (~~ii~~B) a statement that, if an applicant declines to register to vote, the fact that the applicant has declined to register will remain confidential and will be used only for voter registration purposes; ~~and~~\n>\n> (~~iii~~C) a statement that if an applicant does register to vote, the office at which the applicant submits a voter registration application will remain confidential ~~and~~*other than as evidence in a criminal proceeding or immigration proceeding brought against an applicant who attempts to register to vote and makes a false declaration under penalty of perjury that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements to register to vote in an election for Federal office; and* will be used only for voter registration purposes.\n>\n> _(5) shall include a section, for use only by a State or local election official, to record the type of document the applicant presented as documentary proof of United States citizenship, including the date of issuance, the date of expiration (if any), the office which issued the document, and any unique identification number associated with the document._\n\nThis section is about the design of voter registration forms. It requires that mailed forms include an explanation of what is required to present documentary proof of citizenship and that except in deportation proceedings, the specific office at which a person registers to vote will continue to be confidential. Finally, it notes that the form on the registrar’s side must note what kind of documentary evidence was provided along with any unique identification number associated with it.\n\n> **§20510. Civil enforcement and private right of action**\n>\n> (a) Attorney General\n>\n> The Attorney General may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to carry out this chapter.\n>\n> (b) Private right of action\n>\n> (1) A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter\\_, including the act of an election official who registers an applicant to vote in an election for Federal office who fails to present documentary proof of United States citizenship\\_ may provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official of the State involved.\n>\n> (2) If the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.\n>\n> (3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person need not provide notice to the chief election official of the State under paragraph (1) before bringing a civil action under paragraph (2).\n>\n> (c) Attorney's fees\n>\n> In a civil action under this section, the court may allow the prevailing party (other than the United States) reasonable attorney fees, including litigation expenses, and costs.\n>\n> (d) Relation to other laws\n>\n> (1) The rights and remedies established by this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law, and neither the rights and remedies established by this section nor any other provision of this chapter shall supersede, restrict, or limit the application of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.) \\[now 52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.].\n>\n> (2) Nothing in this chapter authorizes or requires conduct that is prohibited by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.) \\[now 52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.].\n\nThis gives random Americans the right to sue election officials who violate the SAVE Act and register voters without receiving documentary proof of their citizenship.\n\n> **§20511. Criminal penalties**\n>\n> A person, including an election official, who in any election for Federal office-\n>\n> (1) knowingly and willfully intimidates, threatens, or coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any person for-\n>\n> (A) registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to register or vote;\n>\n> (B) urging or aiding any person to register to vote, to vote, or to attempt to register or vote; or\n>\n> (C) exercising any right under this chapter; or\n>\n> (2) knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds, or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a State of a fair and impartially conducted election process, by-\n>\n> (A) the procurement or submission of voter registration applications that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held; or\n>\n> (_B) in the case of an officer or employee of the executive branch, providing material assistance to a noncitizen in attempting to register to vote or vote in an election for Federal office;_\n>\n> _(C) registering an applicant to vote in an election for Federal office who fails to present documentary proof of United States citizenship; or_\n>\n> (~~B~~D) the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held,\n>\n> shall be fined in accordance with title 18 (which fines shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury, miscellaneous receipts (pursuant to section 3302 of title 31), notwithstanding any other law), or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n\nThe bill closes with penalties for violations of the SAVE Act, adding that if an officer or employee of the executive branch of a state provides material assistance to a non-citizen attempting to register to vote or to vote, or if an officer or employee of the executive branch of a state registers an applicant to vote in a federal election without receiving documentary proof of citizenship, that person shall be fined, imprisoned less than five years, or both.",
