Between that and watching happy couples walk around campus, I realized I had been thinking less than gratefully toward God, wanting things I don’t have yet. I may not be in a relationship or have an internship lined up, but that’s okay, and it’s all within God’s plan.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bWGl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F825a9742-878d-426f-9383-5ea9da528d21_1536x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bWGl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F825a9742-878d-426f-9383-5ea9da528d21_1536x1024.png)\n\nRecently, I’ve been reading through 2 Samuel and was particularly struck by Joab in chapter 20. Unfortunately, I see parts of myself in him, especially his impatience to get what he wants on his own timetable.\n\nJoab is not a villain to dismiss, nor a hero to emulate. He is a warning to people who mistake effectiveness for faithfulness. The story of Joab teaches that waiting on God’s plan and God’s timing is the only way.\n\nDeciding that you have the right to execute God’s desires on your own is wrong. Faithfulness is not measured by outcomes, but by obedience, restraint, and a willingness to remain under God’s authority.\n\n**2 Samuel 15:12 (NIV)**\n\n_While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept on increasing._\n\nDavid’s rule toward the end of 2 Samuel is marked by turmoil. Revolts are breaking out across Israel, and God’s people are living through extreme instability. David’s son Absalom has just been killed during his rebellion against his father, and David is publicly mourning. His army, which had just fought and risked their lives, grows frustrated that the enemy they battled is now receiving more sympathy and sorrow than the men who defended the kingdom.\n\n**2 Samuel 19:5 (NIV)**\n\n_Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives and concubines.”_\n\nIn 2 Samuel 19, Joab confronts the king directly, and in verse 6, he says that David loves those who hate him and hates those who love him. Joab concludes that the commanders and their men mean nothing to David, and that he would rather Absalom be alive while his army lay dead. This moment exposes Joab’s growing bitterness toward his king.\n\n**2 Samuel 20:10 (NIV)**\n\n_Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab’s hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. And Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bikri._\n\nThat tension carries straight into 2 Samuel. Sheba, son of Bikri, rebels against David, and Joab is replaced as commander of Israel’s forces by Amasa. In his anger over being displaced, Joab approaches Amasa, calls him “my brother,” and pretends to greet him with a kiss, only to drive a dagger into his stomach and watch his intestines spill out on the ground.\n\nJoab then resumes leadership of the army and pursues Sheba, once again acting decisively on David’s behalf. Yet he remains outside David’s favor, just as he was after killing Absalom. Joab repeatedly takes matters into his own hands rather than trusting David and God’s authority, acting rather than awaiting guidance from both his heavenly and earthly masters.\n\nWhile the events of this chapter are far more dramatic than anything I’m currently experiencing, specific patterns stand out as serious red flags. Taking matters into my own hands, trusting my own judgment over God’s, and demanding outcomes on my timetable are constant temptations, especially when timing isn’t aligned to my calendar.\n\n**1 Samuel 24:6 (NIV)**\n\n_He said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.”_\n\nJoab’s actions don’t always oppose God’s ultimate plan, but they often violate God’s timing. This mirrors the contrast we see earlier between David and Saul in 1 Samuel 24. David knew he was the anointed king of Israel. He knew Saul was unfit to rule. Yet he refused to seize power prematurely. David allowed the Lord to remove Saul in His time rather than taking that authority into his own hands.\n\nThat is the posture I want to adopt. I want to be more like David—waiting on the Lord and trusting His timing—rather than like Joab, making decisions without consulting God and assuming I know better. Even when I might be right in the decision itself, respecting God’s timing is critical.\n\nI once heard that all prayers are answered, but sometimes the answer is _‘not yet_’. While that can be frustrating in the moment, I trust that one day, looking back, I’ll see that God’s plan worked out better than anything I could have accomplished on my own.\n\n_In the meantime, I’ll be praying for patience and wisdom. Until next time:_\n\n**“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.” —Romans 8:28 (NIV)**\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
