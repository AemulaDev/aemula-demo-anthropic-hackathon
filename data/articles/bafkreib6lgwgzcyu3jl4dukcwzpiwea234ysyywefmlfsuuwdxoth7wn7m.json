  "body": "This past Thanksgiving, I helped my sister and my nephew put together a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. As anyone who has put together a jigsaw puzzle that large knows, it can be quite a challenge to know which pieces fit together with other pieces, and hopefully, no pieces get lost.\n\nLooking back on what I have written over the past year, the topics seem to me like a jigsaw puzzle: many address different aspects of conversations, both face-to-face and online, but the pieces have been jumbled.\n\nI thought it would be good at this point to organize my past thoughts into different themes, with each theme being a piece in a larger puzzle.\n\nTo that end, I am creating sections in this article to organize my past articles by theme, with each section containing embedded articles. Some of these embedded articles have other embedded articles within them as well; I recommend you look at those articles, too.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n* [Recognizing a need for change](https://genejoy.substack.com/i/181201380/recognizing-a-need-for-change)\n\n* [Forces at work](https://genejoy.substack.com/i/181201380/forces-at-work)\n\n* [Language and reasoning](https://genejoy.substack.com/i/181201380/language-and-reasoning)\n\n* [Accuracy and charity](https://genejoy.substack.com/i/181201380/accuracy-and-charity)\n\n* [Practice, practice, practice](https://genejoy.substack.com/i/181201380/practice-practice-practice)\n\n* [Missing pieces](https://genejoy.substack.com/i/181201380/missing-pieces)\n\n## Recognizing a need for change\n\nMy main reason for starting this publication is that I was dissatisfied with the current state of online conversations. At the same time, I also noticed limitations in face-to-face conversations that online discussions don’t have. We have a lot that is broken in our discourse, and I wanted to name those broken things. The following articles attempt to diagnose the problems I saw.\n\n[There's an ordinary world somehow we have to find](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/theres-an-ordinary-world-somehow?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Moths drawn towards the flame](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/moths-drawn-towards-the-flame?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[An ongoing conversation](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/an-ongoing-conversation?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Backing away from the edge of the cliff](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/backing-away-from-the-edge-of-the?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Before the wheels come off](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/before-the-wheels-come-off?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n## Forces at work\n\nThere are reasons that our dialogue is broken. For most of us, we mean well, but our aim is off. We need to understand ourselves and others, and take time to think about how we might communicate and respond better. These articles explore our perceived needs, our primary concerns, and our limitations.\n\n[Being heard and feeling valued](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/being-heard-and-feeling-valued?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Hitting a nerve](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/hitting-a-nerve?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[A sea of persuasion](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/a-sea-of-persuasion?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Can I have your attention?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/can-i-have-your-attention?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Scylla and Charybdis](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/scylla-and-charybdis?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Dead on arrival](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/dead-on-arrival?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Things we don't know...that we don't know](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/things-we-dont-knowthat-we-dont-know?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[What settles our internal debates?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/what-settles-our-internal-debates?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Panem et Circenses](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/panem-et-circenses?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[\"Which side are you on?\" part 2](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/which-side-are-you-on-part-2?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Practicing the pause: are social media posts emergencies?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/practicing-the-pause-are-social-media?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n# Language and reasoning\n\nWe ought to be mindful of the words we use, what they convey, and how we use them to try to persuade others. Exercising care in our language and reasoning is essential for productive dialogue. The following articles explore aspects of language and reasoning that shed light on what makes for better dialogue.\n\n[Too deep for words?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/too-deep-for-words?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Credible categories](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/credible-categories?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[What dots are we connecting?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/what-dots-are-we-connecting?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Begging the question, circular reasoning, and persuasive rhetoric](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/begging-the-question-circular-reasoning?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[The \"risk\" of encouraging critical thinking](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-encouraging-critical?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Can I get a refund for my bad ideas?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/can-i-get-a-refund-for-my-bad-ideas?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n## Accuracy and charity\n\nI emphasize repeatedly the need for accuracy and charity in representing others’ views. This is a basic requirement for good conversations. Give people the benefit of the doubt, and don’t cut corners in describing the viewpoints of others. The following articles explore aspects of accuracy and charity in our writing.\n\n[The standards we use](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/the-standards-we-use?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[\"It is written...\"](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/it-is-written?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[The sin of the genetic fallacy](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/the-sin-of-the-genetic-fallacy?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Social media and due diligence](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/social-media-and-due-diligence?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Social media and the custom of ambassadors](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/social-media-and-the-custom-of-ambassadors?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Broken clocks](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/broken-clocks?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Language nooses and proper categories](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/language-nooses-and-proper-categories?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Listening vs. agreement](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/listening-vs-agreement?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Ridicule and shared assumptions](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/ridicule-and-shared-assumptions?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Do you feel personally attacked?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/do-you-feel-personally-attacked?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n## Practice, practice, practice\n\nFor many of us who have been online for a while, we often take shortcuts that require less effort but end up making things more difficult in the long run. The habits that make for productive discussions require lots of practice and will be hard at first, but the reward is worth it. The following articles explore good habits that lead to better conversations.\n\n[Cognitive strength training](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/cognitive-strength-training?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Writing as mental exercise](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/writing-as-mental-exercise?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Reflecting and collecting](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/reflecting-and-collecting?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Practicing the pause: the animated GIF essay](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/practicing-the-pause-the-animated?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Slow down and read it again](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/slow-down-and-read-it-again?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Taking time to see a topic clearly](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/taking-time-to-see-a-topic-clearly?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[The people we follow](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/the-people-we-follow?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n[Habits of mind and habits of social media](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/habits-of-mind-and-habits-of-social?utm_source=substack\\&utm_campaign=post_embed\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n## Missing pieces\n\nI probably am missing some things in the list above; there are likely things I have not covered yet that could shed light on what leads to good conversations. While missing puzzle pieces are a source of anxiety when trying to put together a physical jigsaw puzzle, they are opportunities for writers like me to explore further and think through effective solutions to the problems in our conversations.\n\nAnd if you happen to find any missing puzzle pieces, please let me know. I’d like to see how they fit in.",
