  "body": "When I talk with progressives, one of the most common refrains I hear is, “But how can I talk to someone if we can’t share the same facts?” This is always stated as though Republicans are the only Americans primarily relying on motivated reasoning, while he or she, a progressive, is the paragon of evidence-based reasoning. I’ve long recognized that this is a shared affliction (shout-out to Jonathan Haidt’s Righteous Mind), and that people’s beliefs and policy positions become far more malleable after building mutual trust and recognizing shared values and concerns, and when they don’t fear social death for changing their minds. Recently, a conversation introduced me to another cause for motivated reasoning: Fear of losing peace about a conflict in their lives.\n\nI corrected some factual errors an acquaintance was making and ran headlong into her emotions— fears, abandoned dreams, and politics as religious belief— in the process.\n\nWe were discussing climate, how dry the weather has been this winter, and why that portends a terrible fire season, and I said, for places other than Bainbridge, serious water shortages. First, she insisted that this year is so dry that it would be rough for our *aquifer*.\n\nUh oh.\n\n1. The city I live in sources its water from [multiple aquifers](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2011/5021/pdf/sir20115021_plate1.pdf).\n2. The aquifers are estimated to be [more than 10,000 years old](https://www.bainbridgewa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/354/United-States-Geological-Survey-USGS-Geologic-Map-of-Bainbridge-Island?bidId=); a single serious drought year is not about to eliminate them.\n\nWhen I pushed back on the first claim, noting that we actually have four aquifers, she insisted I was wrong. At first, I argued back, but then remembered I carry a device with the entirety of human knowledge in my pocket, so I shared the map linked above. Though she was initially resistant, I pointed out to her that this map came from the City of Bainbridge Island’s webpage, which maps our groundwater resources. Then I directly confronted her, “Do you believe the City of Bainbridge Island is lying about the number of aquifers we have?” She finally affirmed that we do have multiple aquifers. Eventually, after admitting that our water scarcity was essentially a religious belief for her, she asked me why the water supply mattered so much to me. I shared that I would like to buy a house here, and I really hate that my neighbors are too scared by propagandistic claims of water scarcity to build enough market-rate housing to make that affordable for me. She said she bought ten years ago, and she was sorry we hadn’t done that, to which I pushed gently, “Hey, I appreciate the honesty. I’m glad you’re willing to admit that you just don’t want new people to have the same opportunities that you did.”\n\nTo my surprise, she nearly shrieked in response: “I don’t own a house! I live in a tiny \\[condo]! I wish I could afford a house here!”\n\nSuddenly, I understood something new. She had made peace with the high price of her too-small piece of paradise because she believed her small footprint was required by an extremely limited water supply. I was arguing against the peace she’d made to set aside her dream of home ownership. I heard the desperation in her voice, trying to persuade herself more than anyone else, that I was lying to her, that her eyes were lying to her, that the map didn’t say what she could clearly see.\n\nLike many Republicans are overly deferential to Trump because of existential fear of “The Left,” or of losing their own core identity, so too, many Democrats have organized their lives around existential fears. No party has a monopoly on rejecting facts. Whether it’s water scarcity, trans kids, rent control, or wealth taxes, sometimes, to enable evidence-based discussion, you must also help people see a path to peace and hope if they’re to accept your claims.",
