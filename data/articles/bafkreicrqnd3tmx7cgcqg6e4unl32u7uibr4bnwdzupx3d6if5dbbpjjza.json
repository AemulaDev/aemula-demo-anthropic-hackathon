It is an issue that, unfortunately, remains relevant today._\n\nI left my AP Lang class the other day hoping to find a bathroom stocked with toilet paper and paper towels–a rare combination–only to find the boys' bathroom blocked off with caution tape and a trashcan blocking the entrance. Frustrated, I made my way to the bathroom on the first floor, where a group of students vaping in the rear stall had filled the air with the unmistakable aroma of cotton candy. I returned to class dismayed by the lack of a toilet in the entire rear building, eagerly awaiting my next opportunity to relieve myself.\n\nThis bathroom situation is just one of the many issues afflicting our schools today, alongside other debacles like parking for students, long classes with little to no breaks, and pathetic lunch food. Initially, I believed that the school board's primary responsibility was to oversee our school and others in the county and empower them through policies to create a decent learning environment. My expectations were obliterated, however, after attending my first board meeting last month.\n\nTo my astonishment, the meeting was nothing short of a calamity. For over an hour, I bore witness to the passionate outrage of parents and political rivals, all regarding the book \"Stamped,\" which delves into the complex history of racism and antiracism in America in a style of writing tailored to middle schoolers. What surprised me even more was that some of the individuals voicing their opinions weren't even parents of students; they had driven for hours to participate in our local board meeting. Instead of the expected mundane administrative discussions, I found myself on the front lines of a political battle in a much larger war.\n\nFurther heightening my astonishment was the revelation that removing the book from the curriculum had already been extensively debated during a special session the week prior, consuming over five hours. There was no mention of the disaster zones that are our bathrooms or any other issues facing the students the board is responsible for. The book \"Stamped\" continues to be available in school libraries for anyone, like me, to read. I encourage students to become more aware of what the people who are supposed to be our leaders are using their precious time on and assume some responsibility for the problems that plague us daily. I do not hold the leadership of Hoggard responsible for challenges like the bathroom; it is their job to carry out the rules and policies created by our school board. To all school board members, left, right, and center, stop using valuable resources and time on issues that affect the very few, and please start fixing the problems that affect all of us. After all, everyone uses the bathrooms if they're lucky enough to find one stocked and empty of disruptive students.\n\n_Our schools don't need more shouting matches over books. They need working bathrooms, decent lunches, safe parking, and leaders who actually listen. Until the board stops chasing culture wars and starts fixing everyday problems, students must keep speaking up._\n\n_Spoiler: the bathrooms were still broken after this speech.
