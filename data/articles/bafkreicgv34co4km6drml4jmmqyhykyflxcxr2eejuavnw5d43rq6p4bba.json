What began as stage fright quietly spread into relationships, boundaries, creativity, and her willingness to be fully seen.\n\n**Together, Wilk and Julie explore:**\n\n✅ How fear rarely stays confined to one area of life\n\n✅ Why avoidance feels good short-term but fuels long-term anxiety\n\n✅ The difference between healthy boundaries and avoidant boundaries\n\n✅ How courage is not a personality trait—but a learned skill\n\n✅ Why forgiveness is about freeing _your_ soul, not excusing harm\n\n### 📚 The Amazings Series: Wonder as Resistance\n\nThe conversation also dives into Julie’s imaginative **Amazings** book series—a richly illustrated, metaphor-driven world designed to help children (and adults) understand fear, conformity, propaganda, and control without preaching or partisanship.\n\n**Through story, color, humor, and adventure, Julie equips families to:**\n\n👉🏻Recognize narrative manipulation\n\n👉🏻Think critically without fear\n\n👉🏻Heal trauma through imagination\n\n👉🏻Cultivate courage, wonder, and truth\n\nThis is a conversation about **bridging divides without flattening differences**, about raising kids who aren’t afraid to ask questions, and about reclaiming wonder in a culture saturated with fear.\n\n## 🔗 Explore Julie’s Work\n\n📘 **Get the books (exclusive source):**\n\n<https://thequestforwonder.com>\n\n🌐 **Learn more about Julie:**\n\n<https://julielavender.com>\n\nThe world is a better place if we are better people.
