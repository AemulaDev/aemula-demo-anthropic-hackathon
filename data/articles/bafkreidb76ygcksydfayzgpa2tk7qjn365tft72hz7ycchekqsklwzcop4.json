Butler, one of the most celebrated voices in science and climate fiction, had a deep familiarity with the difficulty of writing while juggling work, exhaustion, and self-doubt. Before becoming the first science-fiction author to win a MacArthur “genius” grant, Butler was born to a poor mother who experienced the death of her four oldest sons before the birth of her daughter and the death of her husband a few years later. Octavia spent years working low-wage jobs, including as a dishwasher, telemarketer, warehouse clerk, and even potato chip inspector, while rising before dawn to write.\n\nHer story is especially resonant for anyone trying to nurture creativity while working long hours. Butler left behind not just brilliant novels but also journals filled with affirmations and practical advice on persistence. Her copious notes and research are now carefully preserved by the Huntington educational institution near her hometown of Pasadena in San Marino, California.\n\n***\n\n## **1. Write Before the Day Claims You**\n\nButler famously woke at 2 or 3 a.m. to write before her shifts. She often worked multiple jobs and didn’t wait for the luxury of free time—she carved it out of a crowded schedule.\n\nThe early morning hours right after she woke up belonged to her imagination. Once she had put words on the page, she could give the rest of her day to her job. For writers balancing full-time work, even a half-hour in the early morning or late at night can be transformative if it becomes a habit.\n\n***\n\n## **2. Small Pages Still Count**\n\nIn her notebooks, Butler often reminded herself that persistence matters more than volume. A few paragraphs, a page, even a single strong line of dialogue—it all added up.\n\nThis mindset releases the pressure of needing huge blocks of time. Long hours at work may limit how much you write, but they don’t diminish the value of the words you _do_ produce. Butler built an extraordinary career out of stolen hours and incremental progress.\n\nShe often wrote her observations of geography and changing weather patterns in her notebooks during her long rides on the city bus to her jobs. The observations originally made from the city bus windows wound up as important features in her classic climate fiction Earthseed series.\n\n***\n\n## **3. Affirmation as Fuel**\n\nButler wrote affirmations such as, “I _will be a bestselling writer. I will find the time to write. So be it! See to it!”_ These were an important part of her discipline—reminders that her vision was stronger than her fatigue.\n\nWriters working long shifts can learn from this: self-encouragement isn’t indulgent; it’s essential to motivation and continuing to create. Repeating your goals daily keeps your dream alive, even when your job feels draining to your soul.\n\n***\n\n## **4. Treat Writing as Work, Too**\n\nButler called writing a job she had to show up for, regardless of inspiration. She trained herself to sit down and write, even when she was exhausted. Butler knew if she waited for the perfect time to write, she might miss her opportunity.\n\nIf you’re balancing a demanding job, consistency becomes your ally. A short daily ritual—writing at the same time, in the same place—creates a rhythm in your writing. One sentence becomes one page. And one page becomes a chapter. She knew that by taking writing one step at a time, you’d eventually have a full story.\n\n***\n\n## **5. Patience is Power**\n\nButler’s first published novel didn’t arrive until years into her writing life. She endured rejection, slow progress, and the grind of survival. She was a firm believer that her stories deserved to exist, and she was willing to work for as long as it took.\n\nFor modern writers working long hours, Butler’s example is liberating and shows you how to find freedom in stolen hours. Success doesn’t require speed. It requires staying in the game long enough to find the right publishers and readers for your writing.\n\n***\n\nOctavia Butler is proof that you don’t need endless open hours to become a writer. You need discipline, persistence, and the courage to honor your voice.\n\nEven if you aren’t a religious or spiritual person, writing is an act of faith. It is an act of faith and belief in yourself and your dreams.\n\nIf you’re writing while working long hours, remember Butler’s mantra: _“See to it.”_ Show up, however imperfectly. Those early mornings or late-night sentences may one day add up to something extraordinary.\n\n***",
