  "body": "US Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) is one of my favorite Republicans. He’s likely to be elected the next Attorney General of Texas, so his Austin-to-San Antonio-to-Kerrville House seat will be filled by someone else in the next 120th Congress.\n\nI like Rep. Roy, not because I always agree with him or his tactics. But I like Members of Congress with passionate yet thoughtful views, creative solutions, and strong negotiation skills on issues that I care about, and who also understand their role as one of 435 legislators. There aren’t many. Roy sits on the House Rules Committee, the official “traffic cops” for legislation and debate rules. Roy is the author of the Safeguard American Voting Eligibility (SAVE) Act. Writing bill titles is quite the sport in Congress.\n\nThe House passed the SAVE Act last April on a _somewhat_ bipartisan vote (four Democrats voted for it), 220-208. And ever since, House Republicans have been pressuring the 53-47 GOP Senate majority - which needs a 60-vote super-majority to end debate and bring legislation to a final vote - to enact the bill and send it to the White House, where President Trump would eagerly sign it. So much so, in fact, that President Trump has been using the bill to push, again, for eliminating what’s left of the Senate’s “[filibuster](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/plot-hatched-to-eliminate-senate?utm_source=publication-search).”\n\nThis is your reminder that the filibuster has already been eliminated for all judicial and executive branch nominees requiring confirmation, starting in 2013 with the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and, in 2017, followed by Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who expanded it to include Supreme Court nominations. We’re the worse for it, but that’s a topic I’ve already opined on as the evidence continues to accumulate.\n\nMeanwhile, polling on the SAVE Act, to require documentary proof (e.g., an official photo ID), shows nearly 4-1 support for it, including among black voters. Yet, Democrats, [who have their own ideas about “nationalizing” our elections](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/how-to-really-fix-our-elections?utm_source=publication-search), are in practical lockstep against it. Their arguments? It’s already illegal for non-citizens to vote (but they do), and it makes it hard for some people to vote, since the homebound and those in nursing homes and whatnot can’t easily traipse down to the local Department of Motor Vehicles and fork over money for an official state ID (there is no national identification card, and there probably will never be one).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JENG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58cbfbd8-5dbf-4e49-872e-901b4f9e81a4_1088x620.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JENG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58cbfbd8-5dbf-4e49-872e-901b4f9e81a4_1088x620.png)\n\nTheir arguments are specious and insulting, and expose their soft bigotry of low expectations. Worse, Charles Schumer, the Democratic Leader, has threatened to shut down the Senate if the GOP majority tries to bring the bill to the floor.\n\n> “I have said it before and I’ll say it again, the SAVE Act would impose Jim Crow type laws to the entire country and is dead on arrival in the Senate. It is a poison pill that will kill any legislation that it is attached to. If House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown.\n>\n> “Let’s be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters. The SAVE Act seeks to disenfranchise millions of American citizens, seize control of our elections, and fan the flames of election skepticism and denialism.\n>\n> “The SAVE Act is reminiscent of Jim Crow era laws and would expand them to the whole of America. Republicans want to restore Jim Crow and apply it from one end of this country to the other. It will not happen. Democrats will go all out to defeat the SAVE Act and defend free and fair elections.”\n>\n> [US Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY)](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-says-save-act-will-be-dead-on-arrival-in-the-senate-and-warns-of-another-gop-shutdown)\n\nThe reality is that impediments are even more severe for people without official photo identification. You probably know the list.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pF9J!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b2e5b54-e66c-4f23-842b-10fb6133bd06_469x501.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pF9J!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b2e5b54-e66c-4f23-842b-10fb6133bd06_469x501.png)\n\n{{caption:I could add a few more items to this list, including entering many official US government and commercial office buildings.}}\n\nHow does one function in real life without some kind of official identification?\n\nA number of states make it easy - even free in some cases - to obtain a government ID. A birth certificate and proof of residence are usually all that is required. And it is not difficult to obtain birth certificate, and even easier to share proof of your residence. I obtained copies of my son’s Virginia birth certificates recently for about $12 each, an easily completed form, and an .78 cent stamp. They arrived in two weeks. Even many homeless shelters help with “proof of residence.”\n\nYou probably noted that Schumer invoked the century-old “Jim Crow” era. Let me allow my Freespoke search engine AI to respond to what “Jim Crow” means.\n\n> **Jim Crow was not a real person; rather, the term refers to a racist caricature that originated in minstrel shows in the 1830s and later became synonymous with a system of laws and customs that enforced racial segregation and discrimination against Black Americans.** The character, often portrayed by white actors in blackface, depicted Black men as \"dumb, cowardly, lazy,\" and dressed in torn clothing. By the end of the 19th century, the phrase \"Jim Crow\" was primarily used to describe the oppressive laws and social norms rather than to derisively describe Black individuals. These laws and customs were in effect from the 1870s to the 1960s, mostly in Southern states but also extending beyond the South.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mLUL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28743f96-af47-4e79-962b-3b849fa79dc3_350x518.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mLUL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28743f96-af47-4e79-962b-3b849fa79dc3_350x518.jpeg)\n\nWith respect to voting, “Jim Crow” laws were set up by mostly southern Democrats, including poll taxes and literacy tests, to discourage or prevent Black Americans from voting. Those are clearly outlawed and long gone, thank God.\n\nToday, it has never been easier to vote, thanks to no-excuse absentee mail voting, early in-person voting, drop boxes, automatic (“Motor Voter”) and election-day registration, and ballot harvesting. In many states, mail ballots don’t even have to arrive by election day. It has also resulted in more errors, if not fraud, in some elections.\n\nSchumer’s invoking of “Jim Crow” is a nakedly racist appeal lacking in any relevance or accuracy. Black Americans should be offended; at least one is.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5a4I!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6aa6659-5d65-448c-a5cc-25d4c8af57ea_736x246.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5a4I!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6aa6659-5d65-448c-a5cc-25d4c8af57ea_736x246.png)\n\n{{caption:US Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT) on X}}\n\nIf anything, _it is too easy to cheat and make mistakes_. The 2005 Carter-Baker Commission on [“Building Confidence in US Elections”](https://cartercentee50c07c05.blob.core.windows.net/blobcartercentee50c07c05/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/carter-baker-conference-report-110121.pdf) determined that mail voting was the least secure of all voting methods. PILF and the Department of Justice are taking “blue” states to court for failing to clean up their voter rolls as required by the Voter Registration Act of 1993. The “easier” we have made it to vote, the more challenging it has become to actually conduct a fair election in which most Americans have confidence.\n\nReputable investigations into international meddling in our election machinery don’t make it any easier. Watch this space, and [read this book](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=stolen+elections+the+takedown+of+democracies+worldwide\\&crid=3RMMHJNEEUADA\\&sprefix=Stolen%2Caps%2C135\\&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-expert-pd-ops-ranker_1_6) (review forthcoming). This is frankly _a much bigger issue_ than non-citizen voting.\n\n[![Stolen Elections: The Takedown of Democracies Worldwide](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wXdH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41348c29-c371-4e70-8247-c41f8f30fd2b_145x218.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wXdH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41348c29-c371-4e70-8247-c41f8f30fd2b_145x218.jpeg)\n\n**Illegal Non-citizen Voting is Real**\n\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation and others have [documented instances of non-citizens voting](https://publicinterestlegal.org/research/safe-spaces-how-sanctuary-cities-are-giving-cover-to-noncitizens-on-the-voter-rolls/). The organization [JustTheFacts.com](https://www.justfacts.com/news_non-citizen_voter_registration) published a 2024 study finding that 10% to 27% of non-citizens are illegally registered. A prior 2014 study published in the academic journal _[Electoral Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379414000973)_ claimed that “roughly a quarter” of non-citizens in the USA were likely registered. So, it’s a problem. Never mind the fact that most of these ineligible voters vote Democratic.\n\nUS Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) has outlined the chamber’s two options to get the SAVE Act through the Senate without 7 Democratic votes available to invoke “cloture,” or force a vote after 30 hours of debate with limits on amendments (germane to the bill, only) and speaking (1 hour at a time). \"The only way that's going to get passed is if we do a talking filibuster or we end the filibuster,\" Johnson [said](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-trump-run-senate-roadblock-voter-id-bill).\n\nHe’s half right.\n\nPresident Trump tried to impose a requirement for documentary proof of citizenship to register via [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/) nearly 11 months ago. But US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, 82, said only Congress and the States could do that - the President lacked the Constitutional authority.\n\nThe only way the SAVE Act or any requirement to provide documentary proof of citizenship, at the present time, barring a successful appeal of Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s decision, is for the Senate to pass the bill as adopted by the House. The odds of either are slim.\n\nThe questions are, can the filibuster be overcome to pass the bill, and if so, how?\n\nSen. Johnson outlines the two options - kill the filibuster, which would likely be achieved through the “nuclear option,” or to wear out Democratic opponents by forcing an old-fashioned “talking filibuster” that might last for weeks - up to 940 hours, according to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD). As a reminder, the “nuclear option” is a parliamentary move to “overturn a ruling of the chair” to eliminate or change a Senate rule with a simple majority vote (51). Normally, Senate rule changes require a two-thirds super-majority.\n\nMany Republicans, including several Senators, now embrace eliminating the filibuster. Their argument goes like this: Democrats are going to eliminate the filibuster to jam through their agenda at the first opportunity, including packing the Supreme Court (increasing its size to 13 or 15 justices) and [nationalizing elections](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/bad-news-for-democrats-on-their-awful?utm_source=publication-search) by banning voter ID, preventing states from cleaning up their rolls six months before an election, and mandating states to accept mail ballots at least 10 days after “Election Day.” We might as well get rid of it and jam our agenda through first.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dgGC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ca4a5d7-2df0-49c3-adfc-5e7abfa87b95_1293x1229.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dgGC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ca4a5d7-2df0-49c3-adfc-5e7abfa87b95_1293x1229.jpeg)\n\nI get that, but it would undermine the Senate's organizational purpose and cause wild, chaotic swings in legislation when partisan control of the Senate changes. The Senate would become just like the House. The days of one party controlling Congress for 40 years are long gone, especially the Senate, although Democrats are working overtime to change that, as they done with California and are trying mightily with Virginia right now.\n\nThe GOP can eradicate the filibuster tomorrow and pass whatever they’d like, only to see the Democrats reverse it all and more after they’re in charge. And vice versa.\n\nFilibusters have changed over the years. We now have a “two-track” rule that allows a floor leader to put a filibustered bill aside in favor of another bill. Filibusters are now “silent,” and simply enforced by a failure to win 60 votes on a cloture motion. Cloture motions, signed by 16 Senators, are now commonly filed at the same time the floor leaders move to consider a bill, and “ripen” the next day for a vote. A “talking filibuster” would require Senators to remain on the floor, day and night, to argue their bill. It is a tiresome standoff for a chamber not known for its work ethic, and there’s no guarantee it would work. It would be a test of wills and endurance.\n\nWhile there are plenty of older Senators (the average age of a US Senator is 64, with eight over the age of 80), there are also lots of loquacious younger ones who have proven their ability to speak for more than 12 or even 24 hours. _Like this guy_.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Hoz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feae2259b-1221-41dd-b77b-571e28e43f71_673x717.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Hoz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feae2259b-1221-41dd-b77b-571e28e43f71_673x717.jpeg)\n\nSure, Democratic Senators filibustering legislation with broad and deep public support would be a bad look. But they would occupy the floor to speak on whatever they want, for as long as they want. And they wouldn’t be talking about Voter ID. Senator Elizabeth Warren can speak for days about the virtue of wealth taxes; Bernie Sanders can lecture us on the virtues of socialism. Tim Kaine will waive his bony finger at the United States for creating slavery (we didn’t, but he has falsely claimed that). Sure, there’s a rule that limits how many times a Senator can talk on the same legislative matter on the same legislative day - twice. And a legislative “day” can last way more than 24 hours.\n\nPardon me for getting into the Senate’s weeds. I’ll try to keep it simple.\n\nBut the clock starts again with motions and amendments. That can be navigated to some extent, including by the floor leader filling the “amendment tree” so amendments can’t be offered, but motions that require roll-call votes and restart the clock remain available, such as motion to table. And as Leader Thune has noted, 47 Democratic Senators, if they all spoke, amendments and all, could consume upwards of over 900 hours (more than 37 days, 24/7) of valuable Senate time when there are other issues to resolve, including the pending matter of funding for several entities of the Department of Homeland Security, such as the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among others.\n\nThere would be enormous pressure on both parties not to cave; the outside pressure from interest groups would be intense on steroids. This could literally go on for weeks, even a month or more, just as when southern Senate Democrats filibustered the 1965 Civil Rights Act. Usually, a deal gets worked out that may or may not produce the desired result, including agreeing to something you might not like. It’s hard to imagine public and media pressure being applied on the SAVE Act compared to something as momentous as the Civil Rights Act.\n\nAs I discussed in a previous post on ending the nation’s longest government shutdown last year, Leader Thune could propose a narrowly tailored nuclear option specifically to address the issue at hand. But there are two problems with that. First, ending a government shutdown is one thing, but ending or limiting the filibuster on legislating policy, especially election law, would be a massive challenge, even a non-starter. Secondly, _Thune doesn’t have the votes_. Too many GOP Senators support the filibuster as is and refuse to weaken it _for any reason_.\n\nAnd then there are Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence who toys with “useful idiot” status by opposing the SAVE Act. He’s simply wrong on this. Enforcing the Constitution doesn’t mean states still don’t administer our elections. US Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), the Senate’s top expert on the Constitution, is correct here:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cx-i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62a58f41-6cbc-4254-a049-68e616591313_593x806.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cx-i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62a58f41-6cbc-4254-a049-68e616591313_593x806.png)\n\nThe Senate GOP’s principled support for the filibuster probably the major reason why Thune didn’t invoke it to end the government shutdown last year. House Republicans suggested adding the SAVE Act to the “minibus” appropriations bill that was just signed into law, but you can’t legislate on appropriation bills, even in the Senate.\n\nAre there things Thune can do in the meantime? Sure. He can force and likely lose a cloture vote or two or three to give Republicans a talking or campaign point on a good issue for them (although not a higher-ranking issue than, say, _affordability_). It would put a lot of Democratic Senators up for reelection, such as Virginia’s Mark Warner, in an unpleasant position. Thune could also try to pry away enough Democrats by offering them an amendment or two while keeping Republicans on board to break a filibuster. Just spending three days on the issue would help attract public attention. It would be nice if supportive groups also used the occasion to raise awareness of the issue.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y2Di!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dea55ad-d7f4-47d3-8f9c-1b0212501239_1440x1080.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y2Di!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dea55ad-d7f4-47d3-8f9c-1b0212501239_1440x1080.png)\n\nThune might get Warner’s attention by offering support for an amendment, which Warner has advocated for and might support, to keep Customs and Border Patrol and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) away from polling places. But I can’t imagine Republican Senators going for that (why would you be opposed to having federal law enforcement at polling places? _Inquiring minds want to know_). I would actually make that deal, because if you require documentary proof of citizenship to vote, you probably wouldn’t need ICE agents at polling places. But I doubt that would be enough. Too clever by half, I suppose.\n\nThune could also try to entice GOP Senators to support a modest rule change, again invoked through the nuclear option, to not allow filibusters on motions to proceed to a bill, making the Senator filibuster the underlying bill itself. That’s chock full of nuance that would fly over the heads of most people, but it would be a welcome filibuster reform if GOP Senators would get on board. That’s also unlikely.\n\nThune and the Senate GOP are in a tough spot. Maybe there’s another “must pass” bill that the SAVE Act could be negotiated onto. But at this point, prospects for a national law enforcing a Constitutional requirement that citizens vote in federal elections look bleak.\n\nIf you want to enact the SAVE Act, you’d better make it a campaign issue and elect more GOP Senators. _A lot more_.\n\nOr maybe repeal the 17th Amendment. _[That might do it](https://ballotpedia.org/Partisan_composition_of_state_legislatures)_. But good luck getting 37 states on board for that. The fact is, our system of “checks and balances” makes it very hard for the federal government to do anything. Maybe we should count our blessings.\n\nIt beats having a government without brakes. _Like Virginia_.",
