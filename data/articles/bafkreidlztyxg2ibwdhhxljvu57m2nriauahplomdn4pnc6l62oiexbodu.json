  "body": "If I had a nickel for every faux pas I committed in conversations with others, I could retire comfortably today.\n\nI’ve broken the rules more times than I can count.\n\nI still have a bit of trouble with conversations from time to time, but hopefully I’m getting better.\n\nAfter finishing _Defusing American Anger_ by Zachary Elwood, which cites the issues of written communication in the section on social media, I figured that I needed to wrestle with this topic a bit more, think through the purpose of conversation etiquette, figure out what my frustrations are, and come up with ideas for better discussions that will help me as well as others.\n\nOne other thing that got me thinking on the issue was [this article](https://open.substack.com/pub/jayheinrichs/p/can-we-talk-waymo?r=4zsycq\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web) by Jay Heinrichs, where he describes trying to start a conversation about Waymos in LA, but the other people in the conversation change the subject. Apparently, not every topic is appropriate for face-to-face conversation.\n\nI’ve found face-to-face conversation etiquette to be one of my bigger challenges: the rules are easy for me to break, and yet at the same time, I don’t always get to say everything that’s on my mind because others don’t always follow the rules either. The rules are there for a reason, but they've also disappointed me by keeping me from saying what I wanted to.\n\nThis is one big reason I’m skeptical when people cite the advantages of face-to-face conversations: it’s not that what they say is false, but that it is incomplete. The rules of conversational etiquette have the unfortunate side effect of keeping some participants from saying everything they wanted to say (OK, maybe in some cases it’s not that unfortunate, but still…).\n\nI’m actually glad for the rules of conversation etiquette, even though I find myself silenced from time to time. Without such rules, conversations would be chaos, things would be worse, and some people still wouldn’t get their chance to speak. I think one reason we are divided is that conversational etiquette is not being practiced as much as it should, at least in my experience. It’s easier to make conversations about ourselves rather than about others, and we don’t pay attention to what others have to say.\n\nHere are some links to some articles on conversation etiquette that made sense to me:\n\n* [Etiquette Today: Good Conversation Basics](https://open.substack.com/pub/emilypost/p/good-conversation-the-basics?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share\\&utm_medium=web)\n\n* [The Art of Conversation: 5 Dos and Don’ts](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/etiquette/the-art-of-conversation/)\n\nThe above articles are primarily concerned with determining appropriate topics of conversation as well as waiting one’s turn, which is helpful. The second link also discusses what to do when interruptions invariably happen. While I understand the intent of the advice given in that article, it is also one of my main reasons for being on social media: my writing doesn’t get interrupted mid-sentence. I get to say everything I wanted to say. Some might say that my getting to say everything I wanted to say might not be a good thing; some things I say are better left unsaid. However, I don’t usually realize that until after I’ve said it.\n\nIf face-to-face conversations really are better for reducing animosity and fostering respect, what can we do to help make others feel included in those conversations so that they spend more time in those conversations relative to the time they spend on social media?",
