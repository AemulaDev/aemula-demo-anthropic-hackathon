A local TV clip was playing on her phone. Trump was at a podium, confident, expansive, saying the cuts were “tremendous—two hundred percent, three hundred, five hundred, seven hundred percent.”¹ He said it the way people say **free parking**.\n\nMaria has been filling prescriptions for twenty-two years. She knows what a discount looks like. She knows what a rebate looks like. She knows what a shortage looks like. A 700 percent reduction is not a thing that exists in her world—or any world where numbers mean something.\n\n**“I thought maybe I was missing something,”** she told me later. **“Then I realized—no, he just doesn’t know what the words mean.”**\n\nTwo days earlier, a patient with Type 2 diabetes had asked her if the new cuts meant his medication would finally be affordable. He’d watched the same clip. He was hopeful in the way people are hopeful when they’re tired.\n\nMaria didn’t know how to answer him without sounding like a liar herself.\n\nShe knew the price hadn’t gone down. She knew her wholesaler had warned her about potential disruptions if pharmaceutical tariffs moved forward.² She knew the margins on generics were already thin enough to split. But what she didn’t know—what no one at that counter could explain—was how a president could say something so mathematically impossible and expect the country to treat it like policy.\n\nThe problem isn’t that Trump exaggerates. Plenty of politicians exaggerate. The problem is that Trump’s exaggerations are often **numerically incoherent**, and those incoherencies are not rhetorical flourishes. They are used as proof.³\n\nA price can’t drop more than 100 percent, unless they start paying you to take the drug. A tariff can’t be paid by a foreign country once it’s collected from an American importer. Inflation can’t “stop” while prices stay high. A trade deficit isn’t a cash loss. These aren’t theories. They are definitions.⁴\n\nAnd yet they’ve become the backbone of a governing style.\n\nA few miles away, in an industrial park outside Chicago, the CFO of a mid-sized educational toy company pulled up a spreadsheet and turned the screen around. The column was labeled simply: **Tariffs Paid**.⁵\n\nThe numbers ran into the millions.\n\nThe company is a plaintiff in a federal case challenging the administration’s tariff authority.⁶ Last year, it paid roughly two million dollars in new tariffs. This year, if the schedule holds, the number will be several times that.⁵\n\n**“We’re not a multinational,”** the CFO said. **“We don’t have a shell game. We make products, we ship them, we pay the bill.”**\n\nTrump has said—again and again—that tariffs are paid by foreign countries.⁷ The invoices say otherwise. So do the hiring plans that got frozen in January. So do the prices that quietly rose.\n\nWhen tariffs go up, the CFO explained, they make three calls: one to suppliers, one to retailers, one to the bank. Somewhere in that triangle, the cost lands. It does not land in Beijing. It lands in Peoria.⁸\n\n**“We can absorb some of it,”** he said. **“But not all. And we can’t absorb uncertainty.”**\n\nUncertainty is the quiet tax in Trump’s arithmetic. Tariff rates change. Exemptions appear and vanish. Refund rights depend on lawsuits that may not resolve before liquidation deadlines expire.⁶ None of this shows up in a rally line. All of it shows up in payroll meetings.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, the owner of a small Italian market stood between shelves of pasta rearranged like a defensive line. He had been stockpiling since January.\n\n**“If the duties stack the way they’re talking about, this doubles,”** he said, tapping a bag of rigatoni.⁹ **“That’s not politics. That’s math.”**\n\nCustomers had been asking him the same question Maria heard at the pharmacy: Didn’t Trump say prices were coming way down?\n\nThe owner shrugged. **“People want to believe that,”** he said. **“I want to believe that.”**\n\nBut anti-dumping duties layered on existing tariffs don’t care about speeches. They add. They don’t subtract. When the price of a staple jumps, it doesn’t announce itself as ideology. It shows up as a smaller bag, a skipped purchase, a restaurant that quietly changes menus.¹⁰\n\nTrump has also promised that tariffs will fund rebate checks—two thousand dollars per household—sometimes in the same breath that he insists Americans don’t pay the tariffs at all.¹¹ Both claims cannot be true at the same time. Neither survives contact with a calculator.¹²\n\nAt a food pantry in Lowell, a volunteer showed me a clipboard tracking demand for dry goods. Pasta was circled in red.\n\n**“People come in with screenshots,”** she said. **“Videos. They ask why this hasn’t reached them yet.”**\n\nThis is where Trump’s numerical absurdities do their most damage. Not because they’re wrong—but because they **reprogram expectations**. They tell people relief has already happened, that if you’re still struggling, the problem must be you, or the store, or the pharmacist.\n\nWhen Trump says inflation has “stopped,” he’s confusing a rate with a level.¹³ When he says prices have “come way down,” he’s narrating a reversal that never occurred. When he says a 700 percent decrease, he’s offering magic.\n\nMagic is comforting. Math is not.\n\nA retired machinist in New Hampshire told me he delayed replacing his refrigerator because he’d heard appliances would get cheaper once the trade fight settled. The compressor finally died in February. The replacement cost more than the one he’d bought a decade earlier.¹⁴\n\n**“I waited for the miracle,”** he said. **“It didn’t come.”**\n\nNone of this would matter if Trump’s numbers were just noise. But they aren’t. They justify policies that raise prices, squeeze margins, and then deny the squeeze exists. They turn definitional errors into governing principles.\n\nA country can survive disagreement. It cannot survive the routine abandonment of arithmetic.\n\nAt Maria’s pharmacy, the patient with diabetes came back the next week. He had checked the price again. It was the same.\n\n**“I guess it hasn’t hit us yet,”** he said.\n\nMaria rang him up and handed him the receipt.\n\n**“No,”** she said quietly. **“This is it.”**\n\nThe danger of a 700 percent decrease isn’t that it’s a lie. It’s that it teaches people to stop trusting their own eyes when the receipt doesn’t match the speech—and to wait, just a little longer, for a miracle that never arrives.\n\n⸻\n\n**Biibliography**\n\n1\\.
