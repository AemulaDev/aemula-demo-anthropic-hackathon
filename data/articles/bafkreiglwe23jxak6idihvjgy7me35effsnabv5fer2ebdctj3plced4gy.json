My dog Sofia wasn’t out long before trading an outdoor romp for a warm bed. The year is ending the way a New England storm begins — deceptively calm. As I look out the window, it’s just gray, nothing’s happening, but out over the Piscataqua the wind is building off the Atlantic, and by the time it reaches shore it’s too late to get a fire going. Maybe I’m tuned to it more this year because I’ve been living inside weather while writing _Breach_, my book about a polar vortex gone feral. And while we brace for winter here, other Americans are learning that climate damage doesn’t always arrive as snow or ice — sometimes it comes as smoke you can’t see until it’s already filling your lungs.\n\nIn Denver, the morning looked harmless — pale-blue horizon, the Rockies faint in the distance — until wildfire smoke rolled back in and filled pediatric waiting rooms with children clutching inhalers. A television in the lobby silently streamed Trump speaking about “energy dominance,” even as his administration accelerated fossil-fuel production through the January 20 directive to “Unleash American Energy”¹ — calling for fast-tracked drilling, weakened environmental permitting, and the retreat of clean-energy standards. Federal action doesn’t cause the smoke that burned those children’s throats, but it does weaken the systems that would have warned them sooner, modeled where the plume would travel, and prepared hospitals before the doors opened.\n\nOn the coast of Maine, where tides slap granite and winter wages war on your joints, a lobsterman named Clay told a Portland reporter recently, “We just need reliable power. The price keeps going up, and no one here can tell us why.”² The offshore wind projects meant to power roughly 2.5 million homes and support tens of thousands of jobs³ were abruptly suspended in December — Vineyard Wind, Revolution Wind, Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind — frozen by a Department of the Interior order citing “national security.”⁴ That justification was thin. Multiple Defense Department reviews prior to the freeze had found no meaningful threat.⁵ The pause destabilized billions in planned investment across five states, threw permitting into chaos, and handed fossil-fuel generators a quiet victory.\n\nThe administration’s public rationale? Offshore wind could “interfere with naval radar and endanger America.”⁶ Here is the reality: the Pentagon already assessed those risks, approved mitigations, and cleared the very same projects. Cutting-edge radar-absorbing turbine coatings and spacing maps already exist. “National security” was not a concern — it was a crowbar.\n\nFarther inland, in the sagebrush basins of Wyoming, federal policy rolled back protections on millions of acres of habitat across eight western states, opening public lands to drilling and mining.⁷ Rural towns that rely on hunting, recreation, and tourism — their local economies as fragile as the birds those laws once protected — now face a landscape being industrialized piece by piece. In a policy sense, this is the same play: fracture what is slow, enduring, interdependent — in exchange for what is immediate.\n\nThen came the seismic blow — December 17, 2025 — when the Trump administration announced its plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the nation’s premier climate and weather-research institution.⁸ “One of the largest sources of climate alarmism,” the White House Budget Office said.⁹ NCAR is not a think tank. It is the nervous system behind America’s ability to understand atmospheric risk — a research center that powers wildfire-spread models, hurricane-path forecasts, flood-risk maps, and the simulations that FEMA quietly relies on when deciding where to send generators before a storm. As NCAR scientist Dr. Alison Nugent said, “Without NCAR, we lose the ability to see what’s coming.”¹⁰\n\nIf NCAR is the map, NOAA is the alarm. Proposed cuts for Fiscal Year 2026 slash roughly 28 percent of NOAA’s operating budget and target its climate and ocean research divisions for the knife.¹¹ Contracts that fund coastal-erosion monitoring, buoy networks, satellite data acquisition, and atmospheric measurement are already being delayed or left to expire. NOAA’s Cooperative Institute network — universities that train the next generation of meteorologists — face a mass funding evaporation that will not show up in headlines today, but will echo in every storm forecast ten years from now.\n\nThe counterargument — the one the administration leans on — is stated with clean-lined confidence: climate research is bloated bureaucracy; cutting it frees taxpayer dollars; fossil-fuel expansion stabilizes prices and strengthens U.S. power.¹² The cutting answer is this: U.S. emissions began rising again in 2025 after years of decline, according to Rhodium Group.¹³ Energy prices in Maine climbed anyway. And every dollar cut from NCAR and NOAA buys a future where storms give less warning, fires spread faster, and cities like Houston or Miami or Boston discover only when the water reaches their knees that the data they needed had been dismantled.\n\nGlobal climate cooperation — once led by U.S. modeling capacity — now falters when America steps back. As the Center for Climate and Security put it, “U.S. credibility rests on its scientific ability to assess risk. Without that, the world loses its compass.”¹⁴ When scientists lose instruments, governments lose foresight, and democracies lose trust. That is the connective tissue to everything else this administration is doing — surveillance, censorship, erosion of rights. Power is not taken all at once. It is hollowed slowly — by removing the tools that let the public know what is happening outside their window.\n\nTonight in New England, the air is still, the snow is waiting, the sky is quiet. Sofia is asleep by the kitchen stove, where a turkey carcass is boiling down for future gravy. Her legs are twitching like she is dreaming of running — a world where cold is only something you feel on your skin, not something built into policy. But the storm is already building offshore, unseen. And winter storms, once they crest, rarely give you time to get warm.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
