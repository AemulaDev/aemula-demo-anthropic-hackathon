It drifted down Pennsylvania Avenue, past security gates now shaped like golden arches, and into the nostrils of foreign diplomats who had, mistakenly, arrived hungry.\n\n“It’s like if Disney ran a coup,” muttered a journalist from Berlin, staring at the contact-paper gold leaf curling off a column.\n\nA portrait of George Washington watched from above the entrance, eyes suspiciously glossy beneath decades of varnish.\n\nInside, the Trump House—it was the White House before the renaming—glowed a rotating LED banner that read: **“Jobs. Carbs. Freedom.”** The East Room had become the Food Court of Freedom™, featuring two McDonald’s, a KFC, and a Pennsylvania’s Donuts outpost that recently won the Presidential Breakfast Award for “Best in Jelly Deployment.” Wendy’s was represented — her statue wore a MAGA hat and gripped an AR-15.\n\n**“Some presidents built libraries. I built history you can chew.”**\n\nPresident Trump personally oversaw the redesign, citing Versailles, Caesar’s Palace, and “that Panda Express in Tulsa” as influences. Columns were rewrapped in foil-gold contact sheets sourced from a Dollar Tree in Ohio. The carpet, plastered with $100 bills and eagles, crinkled like a clearance bin of expired fireworks. All staff phones had been replaced with fry-station buzzers.\n\nPress access was limited to porta-johns on the South Lawn, now rebranded as **Truth Corridors.** Each stall was equipped with an iPad preloaded with Truth Social and a Sharpie-ed First Amendment, redacted except for the words “speech” and “Trump.” CNN requested a second stall after theirs began emitting Don Jr. vape-scented soundbites on loop.\n\n**Reporters were reminded that access was a privilege, not a right — a phrase now carved into the Resolute Desk.**\n\nThe Rose Garden had again been bulldozed. “This time correctly,” Trump said. In its place: **Putting for Patriots™**, the world’s largest miniature golf course. Hole One featured the Second Amendment in neon cursive, guarded by animatronic colonists who shouted “Stand your ground!” Hole Nine, titled **Deep State Drain**, required players to putt over a spinning Fauci head into a golden ballot box labeled **STOLEN.**\n\n**The scorecards were pre-filled.**\n\nAsked whether this undermined public trust, a spokesperson clarified: “They’re not golf scores. They’re freedom metrics.”\n\nMidway through the tour, visitors were funneled into **Founders on Tap,** an AI-powered bar that served constitutional cocktails and algorithmic nostalgia. The Thomas Jefferson bot offered hard lemonade and said, _“A little rebellion now and then is good for the soul — as long as it’s ours.”_ Benjamin Franklin, slurring from centuries of virtual whiskey, reminded patrons, _“Liberty is best enjoyed behind a paywall.”_\n\nThe Lincoln Bedroom was converted into the **Forever Suite,** reserved for loyalists and foreign dignitaries who agreed to stay three nights and leave a five-star review. A **Patriot Vetting Portal,** built by the former FEMA director, scanned guests for pronoun use, vaccinated children, and CNN viewing habits.\n\n**“The questions are voluntary,” one aide explained. “Refusing just ends the tour.”**\n\nThe presidential library had become a boiler room shrine to Executive Orders, arranged by retweet count. A glass case once reserved for the Emancipation Proclamation now displayed the subpoena from Trump’s third indictment, sealed in resin and lit from below like the Constitution at the National Archives. A plaque above read: **“Not Removed. Improved.”**\n\n**“History is flexible. I’m just bringing her home.”**\n\nIn the hallways, Washington’s gaze followed visitors from every portrait, his painted eyes growing duller with each selfie.\n\nOutside, visitors lined up for merchandise, funnel cakes, and loyalty selfies. A man in a **Gravy Force™** jersey wept: “I just feel like America’s back.” Nearby, tourists pledged oaths in the **Hall of Loyalty™,** where the only exhibit was a mirror. It remained the most-viewed attraction in the building.\n\nTourism surged 600% in the first month.\n\nGlobal reaction was swift. The EU Parliament condemned “the franchising of executive property into personal cult infrastructure.” France convened an emergency summit on dignity. Canada closed its southern border.\n\nTrump remained unfazed. He presided over the ceremonial relighting of the permanent Christmas Tree, now co-sponsored by MyPillow and Goop. Fireworks were triggered by saying _“Biden cheated”_ into a mic shaped like a bald eagle. Diddy Combs, newly pardoned, headlined the event.\n\n“All he did was help young entrepreneurs find opportunity,” Trump said.\n\nThe East Colonnade now featured life-sized bronze statues of former staffers, each mid-applause. “It’s just respectful,” said Stephen Miller, Director of Narrative Operations. “Our patriots deserve to be preserved at peak loyalty.” A roped-off statue of Melania stood tallest—serene, exaggerated, unreal.\n\n**“They finally got it right,” Trump smiled. “It’s based on that magazine shoot from her twenties. Beautiful work. Historic.”**\n\n**“The First Lady’s beauty is an American export,”** Miller added, adjusting the spotlight for optimal gleam.\n\nVisitors were asked not to touch the base—“It’s fragile and Italian”—but many left roses, candles, and gently used handbags. One woman knelt and whispered, _“Thank you for standing by him.”_\n\nThe final exhibit—**Pentagon of Power™**—featured a backlit copy of _The Art of the Deal_ and a looped video of Trump explaining tariffs. Entry came with a certificate of indoctrination and a coupon for one free KFC Popcorn Patriot Bucket™.\n\nThat night, as the Food Court of Freedom™ flipped to its all-night menu, a janitor paused beside the bust of George Washington.\n\nHe caught his reflection in the glass—and flinched. Just for a moment. Then looked away.\n\nThe air had gone still.\n\nThe chants were gone.\n\nThe fryer buzz had faded.\n\n**The bust seemed to glisten.**\n\n“It’s probably just condensation,” the janitor muttered.\n\n**He knew better.**\n\nGeorge Washington was weeping mayonnaise.\n\nOutside, tour buses kept arriving. Headlights swept the facade like searchlights over a crime scene no one wanted to investigate.\n\nThe scent of fryer grease drifted into the night.\n\n**It smelled, unmistakably, like victory — and like something too deep, too artificial, to ever scrub out.**",
