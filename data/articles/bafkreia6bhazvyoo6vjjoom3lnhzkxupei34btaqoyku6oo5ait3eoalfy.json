Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nMy cousin and I have been eagerly awaiting the weekly drops of _The Summer I Turned Pretty_ since the first episode of the final season earlier this summer. And as a resident of Cousins Beach—better known as Wilmington, North Carolina—I've also been watching the sets, crews, and ripple effects of Prime Video's breakout romance drama play out right in my backyard.\n\nDespite the fierce debate between Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah (Conrad, duh!), there's no debate that _TSITP_ has been a massive boost for Wilmington's local economy. According to a _[Wilmington Business Journal](https://www.wilmingtonbiz.com/film/2025/02/12/officials_count_film_dollars_challenges/26300)_ report from February 2025, over $300 million was spent directly by streaming services and film producers in North Carolina last year.\n\nA large share of that money flowed into Wilmington to produce the next wave of hit shows and films. That's a deep impact on a region with a population of just over 450,000, many of whom are students and retirees, where a single production can feel like a tidal wave of money and opportunity washing over a small-town economy. Altogether, productions like _The Summer I Turned Pretty_ create and maintain thousands of local jobs each season.\n\nAnd while Lola Tung, who plays Isabel 'Belly' Conklin, is flown into Wilmington to live out her love triangle fantasies, over 150 full-time crew members who live in and around Wilmington are employed to support the main cast. On top of that, the Wilmington Regional Film Commission estimates that over 1,600 short-term jobs—extras, support staff, background partygoers, and last-minute wedding attendees—are created during filming.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Uua!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa39cb127-f220-4ebe-8be5-1854f7036230_741x989.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Uua!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa39cb127-f220-4ebe-8be5-1854f7036230_741x989.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The real Cousins Beach | photo by Crawford Anderson (yes, that's me!)}}\n\nWilmington's not called 'Wilmywood' for nothing. With about 1,200 active film industry employees, it has the largest pool of supporting actors and crew on the East Coast outside of Atlanta. That depth of talent is exactly why productions like _TSITP_, Prime Video's _The_ _Runarounds_, and Netflix's _The Waterfront_ keep rolling in, and why Wilmington remains the go-to destination for production giants looking to stretch their budgets without sacrificing quality.\n\nWhile studios spent hundreds of millions just last year, the downstream effects are even larger. Thousands of employees eat at local Wilmington restaurants, send their kids to local schools, and pay into the tax base that funds emergency services and roadway repairs, creating ripple effects that power the local economy. Even years after shows have wrapped, superfans flocking to famous sets keep money flowing into local attractions and eateries. Just ask the diehards still visiting the backdrops of _One Tree Hill_ or _Dawson's Creek._\n\nFinally, local carpenters, electricians, caterers, and drivers are hired on temporary contracts, boosting hundreds more jobs and small businesses that wouldn't exist without the deep pockets of Amazon, Netflix, and other major studios. These transactions turn a temporary shoot into a lifeline for small businesses. From coffee shops slammed with crew orders to local equipment rental shops cashing checks, the money keeps Wilmington's economy humming long after the cameras leave.\n\nAnd while the most popular romance of the summer may be over, Wilmington's receipts will outlast the love triangle. Amazon may have left with its finale, but the cash it pumped into North Carolina is still circulating through hotels, shops, and paychecks. Fans can debate the ending all they want, but North Carolina's economy already got its happily ever after.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
