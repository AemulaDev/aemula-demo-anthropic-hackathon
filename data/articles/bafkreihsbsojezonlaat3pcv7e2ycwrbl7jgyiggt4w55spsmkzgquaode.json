  "body": "Most people never move past the headline — and that’s precisely where the cognitive framing begins.\n\nThis episode of _How to Analyse Headlines_ breaks down the invisible architecture of news language: how a single verb, an emotionally charged label, or a carefully chosen metaphor can tilt our perception of political events long before we reach the first paragraph. Using the media coverage of Zohran Mamdani’s election as a case study, I’ll show how headlines aren’t neutral signposts but powerful narrative devices. Change one word — _“fight,” “win,” “socialist”_ — and you change the emotional temperature of the entire story.\n\n**You’ll learn how to:**\n\n* Detect manipulative phrasing, strategic omissions, and emotional triggers\n\n* Decode metaphorical framing, tonal cues, and ideological subtext\n\n* Understand how headlines operate as fast, automatic behavioral nudges\n\nIf up to 75% of political links are shared without being read, then headlines aren’t summaries — they’re precision-engineered influence instruments. They shape what we notice, what we ignore, and which interpretations feel “natural” before we’ve even registered the details.\n\nThis series teaches you how to see the frame **before** it shapes you.\nLet’s learn to read headlines critically — and reclaim our attention from the people who design them.\n\n[Watch Video](https://karat.substack.com/p/how-to-analyse-headlines)",
