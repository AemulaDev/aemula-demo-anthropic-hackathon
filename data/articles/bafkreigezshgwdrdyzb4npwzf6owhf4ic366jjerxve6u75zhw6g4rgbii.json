That's institutional gaslighting caught on camera.\n\n🔍 This is what elite political deception looks like:\n• Question substitution\n• Consensus manufacturing\n• Reality denial in real-time\n• Professional institutional betrayal\n\n14 years as Dutch PM. NATO Secretary General. And when asked if there's a plan for when NATO's superpower threatens another member, he's got... nothing. Just smooth talk and empty promises.\n\n🎯 Full analysis exposes every technique, every manipulation, every calculated lie.\n\nThis is how alliances collapse—not with explosions, but with bureaucrats pretending everything's fine while the building burns.\n\nJoin me on Substack: <https://karat.substack.com>\n\n💬 Drop a comment if you caught what he's really doing here\n\n🔔 Subscribe for more political discourse analysis that cuts through the BS\n\n⚠️ Another example of Hollywood Propaganda:\n\n{{youtube:RjDCT3bf18A}}",
