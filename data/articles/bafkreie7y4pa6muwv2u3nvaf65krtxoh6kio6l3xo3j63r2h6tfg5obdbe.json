Jerome Powell & Co. at the Fed unleashed a tidal wave of printed money to keep banks from collapsing, but that flood would soon swamp Silicon Valley Bank in ways nobody imagined._\n\nIn 2020, the coronavirus upended the world, leading to over $4 trillion being injected into the economy by various government agencies, including The Small Business Administration and The Department of Treasury. The ensuing market crash prompted cautious investors to seek refuge in safe government-issued bonds. The United States releases Treasury bonds, notes, and bills with different maturity durations. T-bonds reach maturity in twenty to thirty years, T-notes usually mature within two to ten years, and T-bills have shorter terms spanning four weeks to one year. The prices of these bonds fall when yields rise. Companies and institutions generally hold a mixture of these cash-like assets.\n\nDuring the pandemic, technology companies thrived as online interactions surged. Stock prices of companies like Zoom and Amazon reached record highs. Despite the crisis, the stock market seemed unstoppable, and tech companies deposited their surging wealth in SVB. Deposits at the bank soared by 86% to over $180 billion.\n\nAs the world reopened in mid-2021, the pandemic's aftermath became apparent. Staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions fueled record-breaking inflation. To combat this, The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to curb spending and stabilize prices. SVB struggled to lend its massive deposit influx quickly and turned to long-term T-bonds and notes, yielding just 1-2%. While not an abnormal or bad investment, holding such a large amount of those bonds locked up the bank’s funds for extended periods. In the last decade, interest rates have remained low, and bonds yielding under 2% had sufficient liquidity.\n\n_I'm sure injecting trillions into the economy won't have any downstream impacts though… Next time, we'll watch those \"no big deal\" deposits pile up at SVB until the walls start closing in._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
