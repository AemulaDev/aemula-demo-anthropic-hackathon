I hope this will help frame the issue and facilitate a comparison of these situations with social media usage.\n\n1. Your house, office, or school building is on fire.\n\n2. There is an active shooter situation in your area.\n\n3. You see someone having a heart attack, stroke, seizure or other medical emergency.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you, this is not a time for pausing and reflecting; you need to think quickly, pay attention to your surroundings, and stay safe.\n\nThat being said, the above situations are also less than ideal times for being on social media or browsing the internet.\n\nSocial media posts _can_ feel like emergencies.\n\n_But are they?_\n\nWhat would make a social media post an emergency, such that we need to react to it immediately, and time is of the essence?\n\nBefore going any further, take some time to think about this. The questions I am asking are **not** emergencies.\n\n### Times when it is better to reflect than react\n\nI am tempted to put everything that is not an emergency in this category, but we still operate automatically for many tasks, and that’s a good thing. However, most of us recognize that there are times when we need to take our time to get things right. Here, I want to consider situations where most people would agree that pausing and taking time to think is the preferred course of action.\n\n1. Taking an exam as a course requirement for school or for a professional certification.\n\n2. Preparing a court case to go to trial.\n\n3. Filing taxes.\n\nThere is a lot at stake with each of the above activities, but none is a matter of life and death, and there is usually no pressing emergency to respond right away. In these scenarios, most people step back and think about what needs to be done to make sure everything’s right.\n\nWhat is at stake with the social media posts we interact with? What do we stand to gain or lose by our interactions?\n\nIs it worth taking a little more time to respond to a social media post? Why or why not?\n\nTake your time, there is no deadline here.\n\n### Times when it feels more natural to react\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, most of our daily activities are automatic, ranging from walking and eating to performing routine tasks at work. We don’t pause and reflect on putting one foot in front of the other while we walk; we do it without thinking. We also react quickly when we are quite sure we know the right answer or the right course of action.\n\nWhy might responding to social media posts feel routine, and what is it about them that makes us react immediately to them? What might we have missed in these social media posts if we hadn't paid close attention? Is it possible that we said something that was better left unsaid? Or are we just speaking an obvious truth to people who need to hear it, and if they don’t like it, they can get over it?\n\nTake your time. It doesn’t hurt to double-check your answer, and you can change your mind.\n\n### Times when it feels more natural to reflect\n\nBut there are also times when it feels more natural to pause and reflect, especially when we know that we don’t have answers or we don’t know what the right thing to do is. We generally consider it worth taking our time to avoid looking stupid.\n\nThink of a time when a post on social media challenged you and made you question what you thought you knew to be true. If you can’t think of a time like this, can you think of a post that **would** challenge you?\n\nAgain, take your time. These questions are not easy, and this is not an exam with a time limit.\n\n### Final thoughts and an invitation for feedback\n\nMy main purpose for my Substack is to reduce unnecessary friction in our online interactions and to encourage others to represent others well.\n\nThis does not come naturally to us; our first instinct is to win, not to understand or even to persuade others. As such, this will take more time and effort on our part, and that will make us uncomfortable at first, but it will get easier with practice.\n\nOne of the things we need to practice is pausing and reflecting instead of reacting immediately to social media posts.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are there exceptions to this? What do you think is the best way to be on social media?",
