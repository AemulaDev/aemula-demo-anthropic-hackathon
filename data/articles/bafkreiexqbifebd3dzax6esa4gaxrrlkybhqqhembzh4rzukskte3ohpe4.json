The only sound was the soft ticking of the clock, a small mechanical pulse that seemed louder every hour. Leonore Burnley sat at her table with the phone beside her, its glass face warming slowly under her palm. Across from her, Joseph’s photo leaned against the counter, the colors slightly sun-washed—his blue shirt faded to a gentler shade, his smile younger than she remembered.\n\nIn the days since the U.S. announced it had blown up the boat he was on off the coast of Venezuela, sleep had become impossible. She hadn’t heard the explosion, but she saw it clearly: a burst swallowed by night, followed by a silence that never ended.\n\nSometimes a memory slipped in without warning. When Joseph was little, he liked to wear a green cap with a frayed bill—he would tug it low when he was tired, the way grown men adjust a tie. She remembered him falling asleep on her lap after long days outdoors, his breath warm against her shirt, the cap askew. She hadn’t thought of it in years. Now it arrived like a soft punch to the ribs.\n\nShe told the reporter what she knew. “He was no drug dealer,” she said. “I can’t get the body to bury it.”¹ Her voice was level, almost calm—grief sharpening into something that cut through everything said around her.\n\nA fisherman in Guiria later described the blast as a flash that “whited out” the stars for an instant.² The sound reached his boat a moment later: a heavy thump, and then only the hum of his engine. Leonore returned to that detail over and over. She wondered whether Joseph had time to notice the sky change.\n\nIn Washington, the President called the bombings victories. Every destroyed boat, he said, saved “25,000 American lives.”³ He told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had “sort of made up my mind” about Venezuela—an offhand remark that landed like a verdict for families with no bodies to claim. Only a minority of Americans supported killing unnamed ‘criminals’ at sea. The applause from political allies drowned them out. Congress tried to restrain the strikes. The Senate let the measure die.\n\nBy then, the U.S. had its largest military presence in the Caribbean in decades. The arrival of the Gerald R. Ford, its deck crowded with silent aircraft, made the word “narcoterrorism” feel more like a pretext. Officials hinted the mission might expand to targets on Venezuelan soil. Colombia suspended intelligence sharing altogether, its president calling Trump a “barbarian.”\n\nLeonore didn’t follow any of that. She learned what mattered from the quiet voices of reporters at her door. Multiple strikes. No bodies. No evidence that fentanyl was on the boats.\n\nThen they told her the part that hadn’t made its way into the press briefings: the fentanyl killing Americans is produced mostly in Mexico using chemicals from China.⁴ The State Department’s narcotics report didn’t list Venezuela as a source.⁵ The contradiction in the government’s own paperwork was clear.\n\nLeonore didn’t need paperwork. She recognized soft evasions in the consular officer’s tone. She had spent her life listening for intention rather than language. It was a skill she had never wanted but had always needed.\n\n_**“I keep looking at his photo even when I try not to,” she said once. Later, she would return to it deliberately—because now it was all she had.**_\n\nIn Carúpano, funerals had become ceremonies without remains.⁶ Families lifted empty coffins because they needed something with weight. The sound in the church—low breathing, shuffling feet—echoed differently without a body.\n\nBack in Leonore’s kitchen, the clock kept marking time she no longer recognized. Sometimes she rose to refill her glass and stopped mid-step, catching a faint agitation in the air. It wasn’t the phone. It wasn’t the street. It was closer to memory—like the subtle vibration she once felt standing on the beach, a distant storm announcing itself before anyone could see it.\n\nReporters pressed U.S. officials. The answers blurred. Intelligence was “developing.” A Coast Guard officer admitted that fentanyl moved mostly through cars at the southern border, not boats.⁷ A retired DEA official, finally free to speak plainly, told a journalist: “If you wanted to stop fentanyl, you’d hit the labs. This is theater.”⁸ Then he added the line he didn’t want attributed: _**“The point is proving you can kill people you’ve already decided are villains—and get away with it.”**_\n\nLeonore didn’t see a villain in the photograph. She saw the boy in the green cap, the young man who wanted to help his daughter, the worker who took whatever job he could get. She blamed “the ones who fired the missile,” and the ones who ordered it, and the ones who clapped.¹ Not Venezuela. Not the sea. She had lived long enough to know when power found an easy target.\n\nSometimes, in the small hours, she tried to imagine the last thing Joseph heard. Maybe a distant engine. Maybe a faint mechanical whir. Maybe nothing at all—just a flash of light, then the long, irreversible quiet.\n\nShe turned the phone face down on the table.\n\nThe clock ticked on, steady and indifferent. Outside, a thin breeze brushed the siding with the slightest, almost apologetic sigh. Leonore stood listening, her hand resting on the picture frame, wondering whether that was how murder travels now.\n\n⸻\n\nBibliography\n\n1\\.
