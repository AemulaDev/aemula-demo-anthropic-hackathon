  "body": "Ever since the prices of everything in life became more expensive during COVID, I’ve struggled with allowing myself time just to write. If I am not making good money doing an activity, I will tell myself I shouldn’t spend time or my mental energy doing it.\n\nBut isn’t creativity the point of life for many of us dreamers and artists? With rising rent and majorly inflated grocery bills, I often feel like all of my creative and mental energy is spent on just surviving and figuring out how to get through the day.\n\nI know the need for rest is so important for thinking and creating, but that also feels impossible at times as the single working mother of three young children. When I am running around between various jobs, buying whatever my children need, or just trying to manage my existence, I think of ideas for writing and about how much I long for a little space and mental energy where I am not exhausted to just create.\n\nAnd then I find myself wondering if this is the point of a capitalist society.\n\nDo the powerful at the top of our current pyramid want us to be exhausted and not create so they can keep the status quo?\n\nI’d love to hear from other writers who feel the same pressure. How are you managing trying to create and balance the need to make money and take care of your life?\n\nDo you have the time and space to write? Share how you make it!",
