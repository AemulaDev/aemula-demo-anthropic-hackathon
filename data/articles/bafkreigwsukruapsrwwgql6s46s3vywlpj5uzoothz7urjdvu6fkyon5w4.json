Now, you might be asking yourself, \"How much should the outcome of a city election one thousand miles away matter to me?\" And the answer ought to be, \"Not much.\" But that's not the world we live in. Among the country's symbolic analyst class, nothing seems more important right now than figuring out how to interpret Mamdani's unexpected success. The contenders in that rhetorical battle seem to believe it will empower them to set the left's platform for the coming future.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j_ij!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa78974dc-4e4a-435e-803c-658534d16518_500x630.jpeg)  \n*Zohran Mamdani, future mayor of NYC?*\n\nI wrote an entire book about how politics goes astray when it becomes unmoored from problem solving, from actually getting stuff done, and instead becomes a battle over competing \"truths.\" In a political culture defined by fanatical truthism, knowledge of the facts or the needs of \"real Americans\" is supposed to quash dissent. When we come to believe that there is an objectively *right* policy and that we (and not they) have the power to discern it, we tend to think that democratic systems are merely mechanisms for turning those policies into reality. And, most importantly, we believe that we ought to be undeterred by the cries and protests of our ignorant opponents.\n\nNearly all of our current debates have been turned into unproductive wastes of time by this mindset, to say nothing of the disastrous policy decisions that come as a result of it.\n\nPartisans during the pandemic acted as if they better understood the virus (and the vaccine) than they really did, dogmatically calling for distancing protocols that may not have done any good and mandating vaccines that didn't offer long-lasting immunity or prevent viral spread (at least not as well as promised). What this dogmatism did was prevent compromise policies that could have protected against the hazards that we were sure of. We could have given people some semblance of a normal life by investing in the least intrusive, most helpful forms of protection, all the while enabling us to learn more about the viral risks that we didn't yet understand.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JZqK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24b492e-ec86-47d7-afbf-1a530a35810d_298x441.jpeg)  \n*If you want to know more how \"the facts\" were abused in pandemic-era politics*\n\nPolitical debates over climate change, abortion, trans-health care, and Israel-Gaza are afflicted with the same erroneous belief: \"If only we berate our opponents into seeing the truth about climate models/youth suicide rates/the definition of genocide,\" then finally something will finally be done. The fact that each of these issues have become coded by a Democrat v. Republic split only makes things worse. Now we have partisan groupish thinking set into hyperdrive by naive realism.\n\nMy hope, both as we've come to turns with how dysfunctional pandemic politics were and with the aftermath of the peak-woke era, has been that grand ideological visions of truth could be deemphasized and we could get back, at least a little bit, to solving public problems. New York's recent primary shows that in the social media-age there may be no escape from vibes-based politics.\n\n-\n\nNew York City has problems. While murders and other acts of violence are, thankfully, much rarer than they were in the 90s, crime has been increasing since [before](https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/the-state-of-crime-in-new-york-city-at-midyear-2024)the pandemic. [Housing](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/nyc-rent-average-increase-wages-affordability-tech/5437274/) and groceries are increasingly unaffordable.\n\nAnd Mamdani has answers: [Rather](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-crime-plan.html) than more police officers to reduce crime, a Department of Community Safety with \"violence interrupters\"; rent freezes to tackle housing unaffordability; and city-owner grocery stores to help the city's poorest. To pay for it all, he proposes imposing a \"millionaire tax\" and increasing the corporate rate.\n\nCould these ideas work? I have no idea. They certainly appeal to people like me: middle-class symbolic analysts. They are point-by-point democratic socialist policy prescriptions, which probably explains why Mamdani [led](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-york-city-mayoral-poll-june/)Cuomo among college graduates. Writer Rob Henderson, for one, [derides](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/zohran-mamdanis-luxury-beliefs) Mamdani's proposals as \"luxury beliefs,\" ideas that aspiring elites believe in order to distinguish themselves, not because they actually help poor people. Indeed, I'm reminded of a line from Musa al-Gharbi's book *We Have Never Been Woke* where he argues that public problems and the people affected by them \"are largely abstractions for \\[we symbolic analysts\\]…little more concrete than the principles we are trying to score points for.\"\n\n[TikTok | @thetimes](https://www.tiktok.com/@thetimes/video/7519536465844440342)\n\nOn the other side, economics professor Isabella Weber has declared Mamdani's [platform](https://x.com/IsabellaMWeber/status/1937846854907314360) to be \"antifascist economics.\" In her telling, deciding how to run a transit system, reduce crime rates, and lower people's rents aren't just matters of political debate but an existential crisis. The subtext seems to be, \"There is no alternative. We follow Mamdani or face democratic decline.\" To be fair, the populist backlash in recent years has come from counties [excluded](https://agglomerations.substack.com/p/left-behind-counties-have-left-behind) from the economic gains of globalization. But the idea that left-populist bulwark against advancing Trumpism in suburban and rural America will be built in a metropolis that voted 55 to 45 percent in favor of Kamala Harris seems at least a little farfetched.\n\nApart from the question or whether or not Mamdani's ideas, if implementable, will actually help working class New Yorkers, there's the matter of who exactly voted for him. Observers on Rob Henderson's side point to the statistic that his opponent Cuomo actually [won](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/24/us/elections/nyc-mayor-primary-results-precinct-map.html) more of the precincts with a low median income.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i4Z-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87c2834e-3bd7-4491-9cb0-3950acfca3f6_578x179.png)  \n*With all due respect to Professor Weber, this seems like its a bit much…*\n\nBut there's a discrepancy here, one being ignored by observers wanting to make political mountains out of statistical molehills. We know the racial, educational, and income demographics of precincts from census data, but we don't actually know *who* exactly voted for whom. All we can do is make inferences based on how well a candidate did in a precinct with a certain demographic make up. There's still a big unknown about what distribution of people within those precincts who actually showed up at the polls. In short, we how different geographic units like precincts and census districts acted, ***not*** demographic groups themselves.\n\nThat hasn't stopped people from trying. Seth Ackerman, an editor with *Jacobin,* [splits](https://substack.com/@sethackerman/note/c-129503710) the districts into two, one half with fewer black residents and another with those having 8 percent or more black residents. Doing this, it looks like Mamdani did better among lower income residents in less-black neighborhoods, which Ackerman sees as proving that Mamdani appeals to workers rather than the laptop class.\n\nWhen I asked him about whether this was a sound methodology, Ackerman argued that black voters tended to go for \"leadership-backed candidates,\" so it made sense to try to partly sift them out. Yet, that sounds like a sort of \"false consciousness\" argument, as if low-income black voters aren't really representative of the working class because they're too enthralled with \"leadership.\" Henderson, for his part, would probably see that as a weak excuse, and argue that lower-income black voters are better able than the laptop class to see Mamdani's \"luxury beliefs\" for what they are.\n\nPolitical data scientist Owen Winter's [analysis](https://owenwinter.co.uk/2025/06/29/who-voted-for-zohran-mamdani/) complexifies the picture a bit. Using a statistical regression technique, which I not able to assess the appropriateness of\\[1\\], he argues that Mandami's support was strongest where the median income was between $75 and 150 thousand. That's not exactly the elite, but nonetheless partly lines up with the typical semi-elite wages of symbolic analyst class voters.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7n4f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cdadba4-120c-451e-a839-68da6225b5b5_862x707.png)  \n*Source: [Owen Winter](https://owenwinter.co.uk/2025/06/29/who-voted-for-zohran-mamdani/)*\n\nTo me however, even going down this line of argumentation about Mamdani feels a little ridiculous. Is this what we should be doing, trying to figure out how *the* working class voted so we can determine whether or not Mandami and his political philosophy is the right kind of economic populism for us to pursue?! It seems just as silly to try to determine before the actual mayoral election and prior to anyone taking office whether a candidate's ideas pass the \"luxury belief\" test. This takes us embarrassingly far from the task of discerning how we might best navigate the political realities of New York City in trying to discern politically feasible and practical solutions to the metropolis's problems, and who has the skills to do it.\n\nWe're here because the left doesn't yet know how to beat Trumpism. And the gaping chasm between the strategies used to win elections and those used to actually govern has only gotten larger in the past decades. Everyone in the left intelligentsia is madly advocating for the promotion of their preferred set of electoral vibes, the rhetoric that affirms their own ideological truth at the same time that it claims to know the political essence of the bottom two to three quintiles of citizens who will determine the next election. That, apparently, is what modern democracy looks like, just another stage of truthist politics.\n\n***\n\n\\[1\\] My last stats class was a long time ago. If someone can tell me whether Winter's use of a \"spatial lag regression model\" is actually kosher in these circumstances, I'd appreciate it.\n\n***\n\n*This article reproduces content from Taming Complexity, a substack from a group of political analysts exploring why organizations and societies make bad decisions about science and technology, and how they could make better ones.
