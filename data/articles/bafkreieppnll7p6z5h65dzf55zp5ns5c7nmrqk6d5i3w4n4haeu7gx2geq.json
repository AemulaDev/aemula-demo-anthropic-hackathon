The blue glow dimmed, flickered, then vanished — battery dead, maybe for good. She’d bartered for it two months ago, trading a loaf of bread and some batteries. The screen still radiated warmth in her lap, even as the cold pressed through the broken window.\n\nThe plastic she’d taped over the shattered pane rose and fell in uneven pulses. It didn’t flap so much as breathe — a slow, shallow intake.\n\nShe hadn’t cried when the power failed. Or when the apartment next door collapsed. Or when her brother’s name vanished from Messenger. But she cried when she read the leaked “peace plan.”\n\nNot all 28 points. Just enough. “Ukraine agrees not to join NATO.” “Crimea recognized as de facto Russian.” “Security guarantees void if Ukraine attacks.” Her breath caught on the fourth.\n\n“They wrote it like we weren’t here,” she said later. “Like our country was already gone.”\n\nSeven time zones west, under the flickering lights of a Halifax hotel lobby, Senator Angus King held the same document. A reporter asked whether the plan reflected official U.S. policy. He didn’t look up.\n\n“It has the stink of backchannel,” he said. “No accountability. No strategy. Just… a payoff in peace clothing.”¹\n\nHe wasn’t speculating. The plan hadn’t come from Foggy Bottom or the National Security Council. It had emerged from a closed-door meeting in Miami, where Steve Witkoff — a Trump-aligned real estate developer — convened with Jared Kushner and Kirill Dmitriev, the Kremlin-linked head of a sanctioned Russian sovereign wealth fund.²\n\nWhat they produced wasn’t a treaty. It was, as one European official later called it, “a transaction disguised as a ceasefire.”³\n\nThe plan proposed sweeping concessions from Ukraine: troop caps, constitutional neutrality, frozen front lines, and recognition of Russian control over Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.⁴ In return, Russia faced no conditions for withdrawal, no penalties, and no admissions. It was a reset button — paid for with Ukrainian territory.\n\nBy the time senators confronted Marco Rubio about it in Halifax, he dismissed the document as “not the administration’s position” and “essentially a Russian wish list.”⁵ But within 24 hours, under visible pressure from Vice President J.D. Vance — who had vocally supported the proposal — Rubio reversed course on social media: “The peace proposal was authored by the U.S.… based on input from the Russian side.”⁶\n\nThe backpedal caught everyone off guard. A spokesperson for the State Department flatly contradicted Rubio’s earlier remarks, calling the senators’ account “blatantly false.”⁷\n\n“It was damage control stacked on damage control,” said a senior Republican aide involved in national security discussions. “Rubio got boxed in. Vance went off-script. And the NSC? They weren’t even briefed.”\n\nPresident Zelensky didn’t name names. He didn’t need to. “Ukraine wants peace,” he said. “But not the kind written by people who’ve never heard an air raid siren.”⁸\n\nThe language of the plan did little to reassure. Passive constructions like “It is expected that Russia will not invade its neighbors” and “Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees” left obligations undefined. Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear plant, still under Russian occupation, was to be “launched” jointly — no mention of withdrawal.⁹\n\nPoint 14 stood out. It promised $100 billion in frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine — with 50% of the profits going to U.S.-led firms.¹⁰\n\n“It’s reverse reparations,” said the same EU official who reviewed the draft. “Russia razes a country, then recovers its cash — and America earns the fee.”\n\nBack in Washington, the document had no clear owner. Trump endorsed it loosely. Rubio wobbled. _The Bulwark_ reported that Vance had quietly helped orchestrate the Miami meeting — possibly without fully informing Rubio or Trump.¹¹\n\nIn Geneva, European officials moved quickly. France and Germany released a revised framework stripping out the territorial clauses and conditioning any talks on Russian withdrawal.¹² “This isn’t peacemaking,” a French diplomat told _Le Monde._ “It’s surrender laundering.”\n\nMeanwhile, the war continued.\n\nIn a hospital outside Kharkiv, 22-year-old Maksym stared at a cracked television screen as the plan scrolled past in muted captions. He’d lost his leg to a drone strike the day before. “They’re drawing maps,” he said, “like we’re not still bleeding.”\n\nThe next morning, National Security Advisor Emma Hathaway tried to reset the messaging: “This document is not final policy. It was exploratory. We’ve heard our allies loud and clear.”¹³\n\nBut Olena had already read it.\n\nThat night, she sat at the kitchen table, her daughter asleep on the couch nearby, curled beneath an old blanket that still smelled faintly of soap and spring. The tablet rested on its back, screen dark, the fractured corner catching the faintest glint from the hallway bulb.\n\nA draft of cold air pushed through the window seal and lifted the edge of the plastic. It moved quietly — like breath held in a room that knew not to speak.\n\nOlena ran a hand over the tablet’s surface and whispered, “Next time, maybe they ask us first.”\n\nThe draft — both wind and paper — had passed. But the terms it carried hadn’t left.\n\n⸻\n\n**Biibliography**\n\n1\\. Reuters. “U.S. Senators Say Rubio Told Them Ukraine Peace Plan Is Russia’s ‘Wish List’.” Nov. 22, 2025.
