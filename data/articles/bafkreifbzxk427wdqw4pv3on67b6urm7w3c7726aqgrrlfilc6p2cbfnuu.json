My interviewer, Julien Manuguerra-Patten, is part of the creative group [Novel](https://novel.audio/), which helps the BBC develop podcasts. Julien contacted me after he came across one of my most viral stories: “[My Year In San Francisco's $2 Million Secret Society Startup](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/my-year-in-san-franciscos-2-million),” which I originally published with _Vice_ in 2016.\n\nMy interview with Julien has now been edited and published as part of the BBC podcast Sideways. It’s #78: “Hide and Seek,” a 30-minute episode about secret societies. You can stream or download the episode on the BBC site [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002htdl), or listen on Spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Eb8EursRmVwZspIwXG0eo?si=9589f564b3234935).\n\nIt’s an interesting episode. My story with the Latitude anchors it, but most of the episode is not about me or the Latitude. (It’s always strange to hear or see myself quoted when it is not part of a longer interview; my original interview with Julien lasted over two hours, but there are only a few snatches of the interview in “Hide and Seek.\"\\[1]) Worth noting: There is a mistake in the audio, which is my fault — I misspoke in the recording and said that Society dues were set at $240 per month, but I think it was actually $240 per year.\\[2]\n\nThe host, Matthew Syed, spends most of “Hide and Seek” speculating about the basic appeal of secret societies. After I listened to it, I started thinking about whether I agree with his ideas. There is always much to discuss about the appeal of secrecy. I’ve spent tons of time in communities where people use pseudonyms or try to be anonymous, including [Burning Man](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/burning-man-2012-the-directors-cut). I’ve written repeatedly about [why I care about preserving pseudonymity](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-love-and-care-about-pseudonyms), as well as other sorts of privacy and personal space. I’ve been part of numerous private clubs and attended dozens (maybe hundreds?) of exclusive events; many of those demanded secrecy of their participants. So this is something I have thought about a lot.\n\nMatthew Syed talks in the podcast about his own childhood experiences and he speculates about the general appeal of hiding, which is why the podcast is titled “Hide and Seek.” Towards the end, he includes a quote suggesting that when you play hide and seek, it is fun to hide, but the most important thing is _to be found:_ It is a disaster to _not_ be found.\n\nThat’s a crucial psychological point, I think. People set up many barriers and halls-of-mirrors that are less about actual operational security, more about discovering and being discovered. On a personal note, I can attest that themes of concealment and revelation weave through much of my artistic and written work. I often find myself hoping people will “find me” through the strands. And when I think of God and the Divine, this is part of my contemplation, this sense of concealment and revelation: Of [being hidden in plain sight](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/what-am-i-looking-at).\n\nBut of course, this does not reduce the importance of actual privacy and secrecy, and in particular, the importance of our promises to maintain those for others. This is another topic I have thought about extensively, particularly when I write about other people.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!avqE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f57275e-c9fb-49df-a891-56006924ed51_3117x1742.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!avqE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f57275e-c9fb-49df-a891-56006924ed51_3117x1742.png)\n\n{{caption:An invitation to the San Francisco House of the Latitude (picture from my original article)}}\n\nRecently I was saddened to hear a rumor that there are community members from the Latitude Society who are mad at me for telling the Latitude story at all — yes, they are still angry about it, almost a decade later. So I do want to be clear about how I considered the problem at the time: Firstly, I did not write about the Society while the Society was operating. Secondly, I asked the creators of the Society for their blessing before I wrote my article or spoke publicly about the project, and they gave it. (In fact, some of them indicated that they wanted me to write about it because they wanted the story to be told.) Thirdly, I haven’t revealed subsequent community activities related to the Society, at least not when the people involved told me that they wanted secrecy; I am generally very careful about getting permission.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, in general, I’ve defaulted to respecting people’s privacy when they are writing from behind a pseudonym, even in cases where I could have made a lot of money or (arguably) served a moral purpose by outing someone. Two examples may be instructive here. Over a decade ago, I learned the identify of John LeFevre, who was behind the then-famous Twitter account @GSElevator. I did not out John and, in fact, when I realized that I’d learned his identity, I emailed him tips for hiding better. A year after I figured it out, John was outed in the _New York Times_ by somebody else (and it was then that I published [the article about pseudonyms](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-love-and-care-about-pseudonyms) where I interviewed him).\n\nSo I could have outed John’s identity a year before anyone else did. And if I had done so, I could have gotten a byline in the _New York Times,_ maybe some money and clout. But I warned him instead.\n\nAnother example that might interest readers is Roissy, a.k.a. the founder of Chateau Heartiste, an infamous pickup artist blogger. When I was researching [my book about pickup artists](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/a-couple-of-my-old-books-in-pdf?utm_source=publication-search), I learned Roissy’s real name and his real-life job. Everything I have heard and read about Roissy makes me think he is an absolutely horrible person, and many of the guys I met in the PUA world agree with me on this. But I didn’t out Roissy in my book.\n\nThe only exceptions I make to this rule are when people violate other’s consent or I find that they have behaved very, very badly in some way. And it does have to be _really_ bad. Roissy is bad, and I don’t like him, but not, in my opinion, bad enough for me to out him.\n\nWhat I’m saying here is that respecting privacy really matters to me. I also put a lot of effort into keeping my promises, including implicit commitments, like the tacit agreement to respect other people’s pseudonyms or anonymity that is understood when participating in a community where a lot of people aren’t using their real names.\n\nI believe I have an unusual level of commitment to these principles, and I have some further thoughts about how I think the journalism industry could do better on them, but I’ll save those thoughts for a future post.\n\nAnyway:\n\n• You can listen to the podcast that features me, Sideways #78: “Hide and Seek,” [on the BBC’s website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002htdl) or [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Eb8EursRmVwZspIwXG0eo?si=9589f564b3234935).\n\n• And if you’re interested in the original story that I wrote for _Vice,_ then you can [read it here](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/my-year-in-san-franciscos-2-million).\n\n—\n\n•\n\n***\n\n\\[1] If I had thought faster then I would have gotten my own recording of my interview with Julien, but I didn’t (and Julien says it’s against policy for him to send me their recording of the interview). Soo… If I have any readers who work at the BBC, or at Novel, then you would be doing me a solid if you are able to get that original recording for me, because my mom has asked if she can hear the original two-hour recording :)\n\n\\[2] To be clear, $240 per year was still too much money for many Society members to pay at the time; and the larger problem was that many volunteered a ton of their time already and did not perceive the Society as a consumer good, so being asked to pay monetary dues felt hurtful and weird. But I still wanted to correct the record since I got the amount wrong.\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
