  "body": "Today, Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University during a speaking event.\n\nKirk was known for his advocacy for conservative causes and his unwavering support for Donald Trump. He was also willing to make provocative statements to rile up those on the left.\n\nI was no fan of Kirk. It wasn’t that I merely disagreed with his politics; some of the statements he made seemed irresponsible and contemptuous of others.\n\nYet with that being said, murdering him doesn’t change people’s hearts and minds. It doesn’t help us to understand one another better. It only bears witness to the deep divisions within our country. I believe there is a better way.\n\nSome might have noticed in the title of this article a line from _Ordinary World_ by Duran Duran (with a small change I will explain later). _Ordinary World_ is a lament, which I considered fitting for today. More than that, it is clear that the discourse in our country has deteriorated to the point that we consider violence to be an acceptable way to resolve ideological differences, which was not true some 30 or 40 years ago. We need to find an ordinary world again, an ordinary world where we disagreed with each other but still respected each other and rejected violence and violent rhetoric against our opponents.\n\nAnd when I say _we_, I mean _we_. The original line in _Ordinary World_ is “there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find“. But the ordinary world that is so necessary cannot be found by one person alone. We need to get there together by listening to each other and understanding one another’s views, even (and especially) when we disagree with each other.\n\nBut there’s another line in _Ordinary World_ which warrants some attention and which we should not follow. The chorus ends with the line “I will learn to survive”, but we need to learn to do more than merely survive. We need to learn to represent one another’s views accurately and charitably, and seek to build on common ground whenever possible.\n\nAs we try to make our way to the ordinary world, let us learn to listen to and understand each other well, and give people the freedom and the space to be heard.",
