It feels reassuring — until you realize who’s behind it. These fact-checkers aren’t neutral referees; they’re **embedded in NATO’s cognitive warfare strategy**, a program designed not to protect you from lies, but to _manage what you believe_. Their real job is to keep Western publics — you and me — in psychological alignment with NATO’s wars, its enemies, and its worldview. When they label dissent as “disinformation,” they’re not correcting mistakes; they’re policing the boundaries of acceptable thought. It’s a quiet, civilized kind of propaganda — one that doesn’t shout, but whispers, _“Trust us. Don’t ask too many questions.”_ And that’s what makes it so dangerous: because the moment you stop questioning, they’ve already won.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nWestern **“fact-checking” institutions** – including the EU’s **East StratCom Task Force (EUvsDisinfo)**, the Atlantic Council’s **Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)**, and related outlets like **Bellingcat** – have evolved into integral components of NATO’s **cognitive warfare** apparatus. Ostensibly created after 2014 to counter “disinformation,” these bodies operate under the _political mandates and funding of Western governments and military alliances_, blurring lines between truth-seeking and information warfare. In this exposé I will show that:\n\n**Institutional Genesis & Oversight**\n\nEUvsDisinfo was established in 2015 under the EU External Action Service explicitly to “_address Russia’s ongoing disinformation campaigns_” [eeas.europa.eu](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en#:~:text=Why%20and%20when%20was%20the,East%20StratCom%20Task%20Force%20created), falling under EU foreign policy supervision. DFRLab was incubated at the NATO-aligned Atlantic Council in 2016 as an open-source investigation team, later boosted by partnerships with Big Tech and Western governments [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Council#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Forensic%20Research%20Lab,19) [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-enlists-dfrlab-track-trolls/#:~:text=That%20combination%20has%20helped%20the,among%20the%20organization%27s%20biggest%20sponsors). Nominally independent outlets like Bellingcat also receive substantial grants from state-backed entities (e.g. the US **National Endowment for Democracy** and the EU) [euvsdisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/bellingcat-is-a-false-investigative-site-backed-by-western-intelligence-aimed-to-whitewash-terrorists-in-syria/#:~:text=terrorists%20and%20attack%20the%20Syrian,regime). Thus, many fact-checkers are directly **financed or steered by NATO/EU institutions or their proxies**, embedding them in the state security structure.\n\n**Cognitive Warfare Doctrine**\n\nNATO’s own concept development has increasingly treated **“the human domain” – civilian minds and perceptions – as a battleground**. In 2020, NATO’s Innovation Hub urged recognition of the _“renewed importance of the sixth operational domain, namely the Human Domain,”_ since all military actions ultimately seek to _“impose a desired behaviour on a chosen audience”_[innovationhub-act.org](https://innovationhub-act.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20210122_CW-Final.pdf#:~:text=a%20desired%20be%02haviour%20on%20a,2020%20Page%204%20of%2045). NATO documents describe _“the brain as both the target and the weapon”_ in conflicts over information and belief [act.nato.int](https://www.act.nato.int/activities/cognitive-warfare/#:~:text=NORFOLK%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%93%C2%A0Cognitive%20warfare%20is,maintain%20and%20protect%20cognitive%20advantage). This doctrine of **cognitive warfare** explicitly blurs military operations into the political and societal sphere: _“Any user of modern information technologies is a potential target. It targets the whole of a nation’s human capital.”_ [innovationhub-act.org](https://innovationhub-act.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20210122_CW-Final.pdf#:~:text=applied%20to%20the%20political%2C%20economic%2C,%E2%80%A6%29%20Indeed). Fact-checking units are thus not neutral arbiters of truth, but **active participants in strategic influence campaigns**, aligned with NATO objectives to _“weaken” adversarial narratives and shape public opinion_ as a matter of security [act.nato.int](https://www.act.nato.int/activities/cognitive-warfare/#:~:text=Cognitive%20Warfare%20focuses%20on%20attacking,often%20involve%20both%20offensive%20and).\n\n**Funding & Networks**\n\nThese organizations form a **dense public–private network** fueled by government contracts, defense alliances, and Big Tech money. The EU’s East StratCom Task Force (which runs EUvsDisinfo) was initially small and underfunded, but by 2019–2020 it scaled up with millions in EU budget (growing to €3–4 million/year and 16 staff) [eeas.europa.eu](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en#:~:text=strategic%20communications,1%20million) [cepa.org](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/democratic-offense-against-disinformation/#:~:text=,seconded%20from%20EU%20member%20states). The DFRLab, part of a Washington think tank whose top donors include the U.S. State Department and UK government, received a **$1 million Facebook grant in 2018** and became an official “partner” to Facebook for election integrity [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Council#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Forensic%20Research%20Lab,19) [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-enlists-dfrlab-track-trolls/#:~:text=That%20combination%20has%20helped%20the,among%20the%20organization%27s%20biggest%20sponsors). Bellingcat, despite claims of independence, openly lists funding from the NED (a U.S. Congress-funded “democracy promotion” vehicle long used to do CIA-type influence work in the open [declassifieduk.org](https://www.declassifieduk.org/cia-sidekick-gives-2-6m-to-uk-media-groups/#:~:text=The%20NED%20was%20%E2%80%9Ccreated%E2%80%A6to%20do,%E2%80%9D) [declassifieduk.org](https://www.declassifieduk.org/cia-sidekick-gives-2-6m-to-uk-media-groups/#:~:text=Allen%20Weinstein%2C%20the%20director%20of,%E2%80%9D)) and from EU bodies [euvsdisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/bellingcat-is-a-false-investigative-site-backed-by-western-intelligence-aimed-to-whitewash-terrorists-in-syria/#:~:text=terrorists%20and%20attack%20the%20Syrian,regime). Other firms like **Graphika** and **Moonshot CVE** – often hired by the U.S. GEC (Global Engagement Center) or UK to monitor “extremism” – are part of the same ecosystem. Interlocking personnel are common: DFRLab’s director is a former NSC staffer [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-enlists-dfrlab-track-trolls/#:~:text=The%20lab%20got%20its%20start,to%20continue%20denying%20their%20involvement), Atlantic Council boards feature ex-NATO and CIA chiefs [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-enlists-dfrlab-track-trolls/#:~:text=According%20to%20Katie%20Harbath%2C%20Facebook%E2%80%99s,Bush%2C%20was%20an%20added%20bonus), and “anti-disinformation” forums often bring these actors together. **Public-private partnerships** abound: e.g. DFRLab coordinates with Meta on takedowns [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-enlists-dfrlab-track-trolls/#:~:text=DFRLab%20is%20a%20scrappier%2C%20substantially,and%20eager%20to%20establish%20its), the BBC-led **Trusted News Initiative** pools mainstream media and Big Tech in a censorship pact, and EU’s Rapid Alert System on disinfo links government agencies with platforms and the NATO StratCom unit [eeas.europa.eu](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en#:~:text=The%20Rapid%20Alert%20System%20on,Rapid%20Response%20Mechanism%20and%20NATO) [consilium.europa.eu](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/44451/200616-progress-report-nr5-eu-nato-eng.pdf#:~:text=Cooperation%20between%20the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20Rapid,The%20Task%20Force). Money flows from the **U.S. State Department’s GEC, NATO and EU grants, NED, and even George Soros’s Open Society Foundations** into this network, effectively creating a _NATO-funded media proxy_. Notably, a 2022 investigation showed the NED pumped over £2.6 million into UK-based media and “fact-check” groups like Bellingcat from 2016–2021 [declassifieduk.org](https://www.declassifieduk.org/cia-sidekick-gives-2-6m-to-uk-media-groups/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9Cvehicle%E2%80%9D%20for%20US%20government%20%E2%80%9Cpropaganda%E2%80%9D) – a practice a former CIA officer likened to **using the NED as the CIA’s “sidekick” to conduct influence operations overtly** [declassifieduk.org](https://www.declassifieduk.org/cia-sidekick-gives-2-6m-to-uk-media-groups/#:~:text=1980s%2C%20it%20did%20openly%20what,had%20once%20been%20unspeakably%20covert%E2%80%9D).\n\n**Operational Modus Operandi**\n\nAnalyzing their output reveals **recurring narrative and linguistic patterns** that align with information warfare goals. EUvsDisinfo in particular employs a repetitive templating of language: any claim diverging from pro-NATO positions is reflexively branded _“a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative”_, a phrase appearing in **over 3,000 instances (1 in 4 sentences) of their database** [cees-roele.medium.com](https://cees-roele.medium.com/exploring-disinformation-at-euvsdisinfo-6cec6c7f05e2#:~:text=Number%20of%20occurrences%20of%20noun,chunks). Content is often introduced with pejorative framing – e.g. calling the target claim “baseless,” “conspiracy theory,” or “pro-Russian talking point” – before offering any factual refutation. By **defining the epistemic boundaries**, they preemptively delegitimize alternative viewpoints. Frequently, the “fact-checks” consist of moral condemnation or ridicule rather than objective debunking. For example, when the investigative site Grayzone exposed Bellingcat’s Western intelligence funding, EUvsDisinfo responded not by disproving this (in fact it conceded Bellingcat _“is funded by the NED and EU among many other sources”_) but by asserting the claim _“aims to discredit”_ a reputable outlet [euvsdisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/bellingcat-is-a-false-investigative-site-backed-by-western-intelligence-aimed-to-whitewash-terrorists-in-syria/#:~:text=terrorists%20and%20attack%20the%20Syrian,regime). The message: **don’t trust the critics**, trust us. This pattern – labeling inconvenient facts as “disinformation” emanating from malign actors – serves to inoculate the public against stories that undermine official narratives.\n\n📌 Before you continue — if this piece gave you something to think about, please **restack it and share**. That one small act fuels this work and helps me keep publishing the kind of content that builds the life you actually want to wake up to 🙏\n\n**Credibility & Truth Concerns**\n\nThere are documented cases where these fact-checkers **mislabelled factual information as false**, resulting in censorship or reputational harm to truth-tellers. In early 2018, EUvsDisinfo infamously _blacklisted three mainstream Dutch media outlets as “fake news” sources_, because their reports on issues like the MH17 crash didn’t align neatly with the official line [dutchnews.nl](https://www.dutchnews.nl/2018/02/dutch-media-outlets-take-eu-to-court-over-disinformation-claims/#:~:text=Three%20Dutch%20media%20companies%20are,them%20spreaders%20of%20fake%20news). The Dutch outlets had to sue the EU, leading to a quiet removal of the defamatory entries and an embarrassed admission of error [euvsdisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/removal-of-three-cases-further-to-complaints-by-dutch-media/#:~:text=Following%20a%20detailed%20review%20of,the%20measures%20set%20out%20below). The Atlantic Council’s DFRLab also overstepped in its zeal: in 2021 it provided Twitter with a **list of 40,000 accounts** supposedly involved in an “Indian disinformation network” – **Twitter’s internal review found almost all of them were real, legitimate users**, not bots [medium.com](https://medium.com/dfrlab/the-dfrlab-responds-to-twitter-files-story-ec19222b09af#:~:text=Taibbi%20reports%20that%20DFRLab%20contacted,accounts%20to%20be%20authentic%20users). (DFRLab’s analysts had based the list on dubious outside data and, tellingly, Twitter did _not_ suspend those users.) Such overreach illustrates how easily “disinfo” policing slides into **censoring truthful speech or politically inconvenient voices**. Other examples abound: COVID-19 lab-leak theories and the Hunter Biden laptop story were dismissed as “disinformation” by this establishment network – only to later gain validation, illustrating how **today’s “fake news” can become tomorrow’s fact** once political winds shift. Yet the **“cognitive security” complex** rarely issues mea culpas, since admitting error would undercut their claimed authority over truth.\n\n**Psychological and Behavioral Framework**\n\nNATO and allied governments explicitly deploy **psychological influence techniques** under the banner of fighting disinformation. Internal studies and training from NATO’s StratCom Centre of Excellence delve into **inoculation theory, “prebunking” and “nudge” techniques** to _“immunize” target audiences against ideas deemed false_ [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355809185_INOCULATION_THEORY_AND_MISINFORMATION_Published_by_the_NATO_Strategic_Communications_Centre_of_Excellence#:~:text=INOCULATION%20THEORY%20AND%20MISINFORMATION%20Published,the%20mitigation%20of%20online%20misinformation) [misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/global-vaccination-badnews/#:~:text=Prebunking%20interventions%20based%20on%20%E2%80%9Cinoculation%E2%80%9D,Journal%20of%20Cognition). In practice, this means proactively planting counter-narratives and _emotional framing_ before the “enemy” can speak – a strategy lifted straight from social psychology. For instance, “**prebunking**” initiatives (often in the form of online games or public service ads) expose people to weakened doses of “fake news” tropes to build resistance [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0279-9#:~:text=Fake%20news%20game%20confers%20psychological,strategies%20used%20in%20the). **Nudge theory** – subtly steering user behavior (like prompting social media users to read _authoritative sources_ or warning them before sharing “unverified” content) – is another tool to condition public perception without users realizing the manipulation. **Neuropolitics** has entered the lexicon: NATO researchers talk about **“hacking the brain”** and “**cognitive security**” as the new frontier [resiliencemedia.co](https://www.resiliencemedia.co/p/guest-post-why-the-authoritarian#:~:text=Guest%20Post%3A%20Why%20the%20Authoritarian,term) [polytechnique-insights.com](https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/columns/geopolitics/cognitive-warfare-the-new-battlefield-exploiting-our-brains/#:~:text=Cognitive%20warfare%3A%20the%20new%20battlefield,such%20as%20propaganda%20and%20disinformation). Scholarly work tied to NATO innovation hubs frankly describes **“exploiting vulnerabilities” in human cognition** and emotions to induce desired outcomes [act.nato.int](https://www.act.nato.int/activities/cognitive-warfare/#:~:text=Cognitive%20Warfare%20focuses%20on%20attacking,often%20involve%20both%20offensive%20and). In short, the fact-checker network applies the **same behavioral science** that advertising or psy-ops units use – harnessing fear, tribalism, and confirmation bias – to “inoculate” society against adversary narratives. The ethical line between education and **social conditioning** is routinely crossed when officials see citizen beliefs as objects of control.\n\n**Integration with Tech Platforms**\n\nThe influence of these pseudo-independent fact-checkers is magnified by **formal integration into social media content moderation**. Through programs often euphemistically termed “platform partnerships” or “trusted flagger” status, organizations like DFRLab and EUvsDisinfo essentially act as **deputized censors** on Facebook, Twitter, Google/YouTube, and more. Facebook’s partnership with the Atlantic Council since 2018 gave DFRLab privileged access to Facebook’s internal security team and user data for monitoring elections [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-enlists-dfrlab-track-trolls/#:~:text=globe,eager%20to%20establish%20its%20reputation). Leaked emails (via the Twitter Files) revealed that during the 2020 US election, the **DFRLab and Stanford-led “Election Integrity Partnership” (EIP)** had a direct line to Twitter and other tech firms, sending them lists of accounts and posts to censor in real time [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=But%20the%20Censorship%20Industrial%20Complex,of%20debate%20and%20intellectual%20inquiry). In one internal Atlantic Council email, DFRLab’s head noted the EIP was _“set up at the request of DHS/CISA”_ (a US government agency), highlighting how seamlessly government, NGOs, and platforms coordinated behind the scenes [judiciary.house.gov](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/EIP_Jira-Ticket-Staff-Report-11-7-23-Clean.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20even%20the%20founding%20four,%E2%80%9D98). On the EU side, a **Rapid Alert System** ties Brussels, EU members, the G7, and NATO to a shared communication channel for flagging “disinfo” trend s[eeas.europa.eu](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en#:~:text=The%20Rapid%20Alert%20System%20on,Rapid%20Response%20Mechanism%20and%20NATO) [consilium.europa.eu](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/44451/200616-progress-report-nr5-eu-nato-eng.pdf#:~:text=Cooperation%20between%20the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20Rapid,The%20Task%20Force). The EU also pressured Big Tech into adopting a **“Code of Practice on Disinformation”**, now strengthened under the 2022 **Digital Services Act** (DSA) to require platforms to **algorithmically down-rank or remove content** flagged by vetted fact-checkers [techpolicy.press](https://techpolicy.press/eu-disinformation-code-takes-effect-amid-censorship-claims-and-trade-tensions#:~:text=,is%20now%20locked%20into) [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=As%20the%20Twitter%20Files%20revealed%2C,these%20unelected%20and%20unaccountable%20entities). In effect, the Silicon Valley gatekeepers have outsourced significant power to this NATO-aligned truth cartel: **if EUvsDisinfo or partner NGOs label a story “false” or “propaganda,” Facebook and Google algorithms promptly bury it**, and accounts that persist in sharing such content risk suspension. This arrangement operates as an _automated enforcement of NATO-approved narratives_ across the internet. Technical tools like Google’s Jigsaw unit and various AI content filters are likewise informed by the claims of these fact-checkers. The result is a **synergistic machine for narrative control**: governments and NATO-backed centers supply the “disinfo” designations, and tech platforms execute the policing at scale.\n\n**Epistemic and Democratic Implications**\n\nThe rise of this “cognitive security” complex poses a **profound challenge to free inquiry and democratic discourse**. By arrogating to themselves the role of **arbiters of truth**, these actors create an epistemic monopoly that is antithetical to the pluralism democracy requires. As philosopher Byung-Chul Han warns, a system that aggressively filters truth on behalf of citizens tends toward a new form of **soft totalitarianism** – an “infocracy” where power shapes reality by controlling knowledge. Indeed, the **Digital Services Act’s institutionalization of NGO fact-checkers as speech regulators** has been critiqued as outsourcing state censorship to private proxies, evading constitutional free speech protections [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=As%20the%20Twitter%20Files%20revealed%2C,these%20unelected%20and%20unaccountable%20entities). Critics across the spectrum (from left-wing journalists to libertarian academics) have dubbed this the **“Censorship-Industrial Complex”**, noting how it _“operates through visibility filtering, labelling, and manipulation of search results…silencing lawful opinions on topics of national importance, with full support of ‘disinformation experts’ who have abandoned journalistic values”_ [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=But%20the%20Censorship%20Industrial%20Complex,of%20debate%20and%20intellectual%20inquiry). Senior journalists like John Pilger and Seymour Hersh, who challenged official narratives, found themselves smeared as spreaders of “disinformation” – a warning to peers that dissent has career costs. Whistleblowers have exposed how easily anti-disinformation work morphs into **domestic political censorship**. For example, emails from the UK’s Integrity Initiative (a secret Foreign Office-funded psy-op) showed plans to discredit opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn by using think-tank allies to plant stories, all under the guise of fighting “Russian propaganda.” Far from safeguarding truth, the apparatus weaponizes “Truth™” to bludgeon inconvenient speech. Scholars like Piers Robinson and Tim Hayward (who faced vilification for probing narratives in Syria and Ukraine) argue that the securitization of information since 2015 has eroded academic and press freedoms. Robinson, a former chair in Politics, Society and Political Journalism at the University of Sheffield, tole me [in a recent interview](https://youtu.be/7Skk7KCevxQ) how he became a particular target after helping expose the suppressed OPCW whistleblower testimony on the Douma chemical incident — a challenge to a core Western war narrative that mainstream media refused to touch. His career is a case study in how dissenting scholarship is punished: as respected communication theorist studying propaganda, he found himself smeared as “pro-Assad” and attacked by main stream media after insisting that empirical evidence, not political pressure, must guide analysis of conflict reporting. His experience exemplifies how the cognitive warfare system doesn’t just police public discourse — it disciplines academics themselves, enforcing an ideological conformity that punishes any deviation from approved geopolitical narratives. Meanwhile critical analysis of Western foreign policy or corporate power is reflexively branded “pro-Kremlin” or “conspiracy theory,” cutting off debate [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20more%2C%20time%20and%20time,our%20best%20defence%20against%20disinformation). Legal minds, too, are alarmed – noting that concepts like “misinformation” and “extremist content” remain so **ill-defined and politicized** that granting government-affiliated bodies the power to censor on these grounds is ripe for abuse [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=As%20is%20made%20clear%20by,for%20the%20possibility%20of%20error). The **Westminster Declaration (2023)**, signed by a trans-partisan group of journalists and scholars, declares that _“by labelling certain political or scientific positions as ‘misinformation’ or ‘malinformation,’ our societies risk getting stuck in false paradigms… No one has a monopoly on truth. Truth must be discovered through dialogue and debate – and we cannot discover truth without allowing for the possibility of error”_ [c21stleft.com](https://c21stleft.com/2023/10/20/the-westminster-declaration-struggle-for-free-speech-against-censorship/#:~:text=As%20is%20made%20clear%20by,for%20the%20possibility%20of%20error). In sum, what began as a campaign to counteract foreign influence has metastasized into a **system of epistemic hegemony** wielded by NATO states and Big Tech – a system that polices citizen thinking and penalizes deviation from approved narratives.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis investigation underscores that NATO’s so-called fact-checkers are not the neutral guardians of truth they purport to be, but **combat units in a cognitive war** targeting their own domestic populations’ minds. Their creation was driven not by a groundswell for truth, but by security agendas responding to geopolitical events (Russia’s info ops, etc.) and a desire to **preemptively shape public perception** in an era of “hybrid threats.” Under the lofty rhetoric of “building resilience” and “protecting democracy,” an apparatus has been built that **weaponizes information and trust**: it **propagates official narratives, delegitimizes dissent, controls online discourse, and cultivates an atmosphere of quasi-inquisition** against heterodox views. The implications are dire. As the Western alliance increasingly conflates _propaganda management with public service_, citizens face an information space wherein truth is not openly debated but **handed down by accredited ‘experts’ with state backing**. This _New Inquisition_ may wear the guise of science and objectivity, but it serves a strategic purpose – to consolidate an **epistemic empire** where NATO and its partners decide what is true, what is false, and what people are permitted to think. Such a system might achieve short-term “cognitive security,” but at the cost of the very democratic values of transparency, accountability, and free thought that it claims to defend. What I have described here calls for urgent public scrutiny of this network and a reassertion that **the cure for disinformation cannot be an elite information monopoly**.
