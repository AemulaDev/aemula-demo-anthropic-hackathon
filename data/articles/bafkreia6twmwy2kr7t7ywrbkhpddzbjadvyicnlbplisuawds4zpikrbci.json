  "body": "In this morning’s post, _[The Bully Next Door](https://aemula.com/platform/article/bafkreibi2bzimxrjdetdc35ikqlggobvstcnsy7dcnslw3uysfmwjw3oza)_, I mentioned Katie Miller’s now-viral image — a map of Greenland painted like an American flag, stamped with the word _SOON_. I treated it as what it was: not policy, but a signal flare.\n\nI’m following up because of what Donald Trump said yesterday, January 4.\n\nYesterday, Trump said it outright: **“We do need Greenland, absolutely.”** He wrapped it in national security language — Russian ships, Chinese ships, strategic necessity — and then, when asked whether recent U.S. actions elsewhere should be read as a warning to Greenland, he shrugged. **“They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don’t know.”**\n\nThat shrug matters more than any formal threat.\n\nThis is how coercion works. No declarations. No paperwork. Just need, ambiguity, and silence where limits should be. The annexation language doesn’t have to be spoken when the assumption of entitlement is.\n\nWhich is why that _SOON_ image wasn’t a joke, or trolling, or a stray spouse post. It fit. It landed because it matched the tone set from the top: _We need it. We’re not ruling anything out. Draw your own conclusions._\n\nThat’s not diplomacy. That’s a warning — delivered softly, so it can always be denied later.",
