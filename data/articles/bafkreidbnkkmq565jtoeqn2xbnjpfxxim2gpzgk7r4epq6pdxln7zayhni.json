It was Game Two of the World Series, Dodgers versus Jays, and the only sound louder than the clack of billiards was the unmistakable voice of Ronald Reagan echoing from the muted TV.\n\n“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars…”\n\nJason—mid-forties, Leafs cap, warehouse manager—froze mid-sip, staring up at the screen like he’d just heard his old high school principal quoting Drake. “Reagan?” he said. “Like… that Reagan?”\n\nThe screen flickered. Ontario’s coat of arms appeared. Then a tagline, soft but unmissable: Fair trade. Free trade. Reagan knew the difference. A few Jays fans cackled. One guy near the back snorted and yelled, “Bet Trump just sh\\*t himself.”\n\nBy the time the next batter stepped to the plate, he probably had.\n\nThe ad had aired not in Canada, but in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania—swing states, heartland, Trump country. It featured Reagan’s clipped, deliberate voice denouncing protectionism in his 1987 radio address. But it cut out the part where he’d just imposed targeted sanctions on Japan for cheating a semiconductor deal.\n\n“You see,” Reagan had said, “at first, when someone says, ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,’ it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works — but only for a short time.”²\n\nThe editing wasn’t dishonest. Just ruthless. Ontario’s ad agency, likely with Ford’s quiet blessing, had turned a former Republican demigod into a cudgel against the party’s current patriarch. It didn’t even have to mention Trump by name. The juxtaposition was the message. Reagan: clear-eyed, cool-headed, pragmatic. Trump: thin-skinned, bellicose, and allergic to history.\n\nTrump’s response came in two bursts: first on Truth Social, then at a hastily arranged press hit on the tarmac in Duluth. “Canada was caught, red-handed,” he fumed online, “putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs. The ad was FAKE. I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10%…”¹\n\nBy sunset, he’d cancelled trade talks with Ottawa entirely. The smell of burnt cheese curds lingered longer than expected that night in Windsor. In the dim light, Jason and his buddy Trevor watched the game spiral. Jays lost by five. The Reagan ad aired again in the eighth inning, quieter this time. No commentary. No laughter. Just curiosity, and the weird sensation of history folding in on itself.\n\n“I thought Reagan was their guy,” Trevor said.\n\n“He was,” Jason replied. “Then they met reality.”\n\nIn the glow of the TV, he watched Reagan’s voice bounce off the walls and said nothing more. \\*\\*_‘First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection… They stop competing and stop making the innovative changes they need to succeed in world markets.’_\\*\\*²\n\nBack in 1987, Reagan had made the case that tariffs—unless surgically applied to punish cheating—were economic suicide. “They subsidize inefficiency and poor management,” he warned, “until people stop buying. Then markets collapse, and people lose their jobs.”\n\nHe wasn’t moralizing. He was reporting from the wreckage of the 1930s.\n\nSo when Premier Doug Ford rolled the dice on using that speech as a cross-border ad buy, the gamble wasn’t subtle. It was a high-stakes attempt to embarrass Trump during a volatile trade fight. Ford had already clashed with Ottawa over dairy quotas and softwood lumber; this was him punching up in a way that felt plausible, even patriotic.\n\nWhen asked whether he expected backlash, Ford shrugged. “It’s a history lesson,” he said. “We’re just reminding people what conservative used to mean.”\n\nFord wasn’t alone in feeling that way. In fact, polling the following week showed over 70% of Canadians supported the ad. Even in some U.S. border towns—Buffalo, Erie, Detroit—local papers called it “a refreshing dose of ideological clarity.”\n\n_Maclean’s_ ran a quote that summed up the surreal inversion: \\*\\*_‘It’s like watching your childhood priest quoted in a PornHub video,’ one former GOP staffer said. ‘Surreal, but somehow deserved.’_\\*\\*⁷\n\nBut Trump didn’t see nuance. He saw betrayal. The ad had aired during two World Series games, hitting his base in a moment of sports-soaked patriotism. “It was to be taken down immediately,” he raged. “But they let it run, knowing it was a FRAUD.”¹\n\nEnter Mark Carney.\n\nThe newly elected Canadian Prime Minister had nothing to do with the ad. In fact, by the time it aired, he’d already told Premier Ford not to run it. But after the damage was done—and after Trump nuked the summit—Carney flew to Seoul for an unrelated economic forum and ended up apologizing to Trump in a private hallway conversation over weak coffee and too many cameras.\n\n“I did apologise to the president,” he told reporters. “I had advised the Premier not to go forward with the ad.”³\n\nCue national outrage.\n\nTo outsiders, the apology looked like de-escalation. But to Canadians, it carried the sly tone of plausible deniability—the exact cultural texture Americans have misunderstood for centuries.\n\nBecause in Canada, “sorry” doesn’t always mean sorry. Linguists call it a multi-functional politeness strategy—one that smooths conflict without conceding guilt. In Ontario, laws like the Apology Act explicitly state that saying “sorry” is not an admission of fault. It’s a pressure valve. A social handshake. A workaround for the confrontational DNA of American discourse.\n\nElaine Gold, a linguist who has spent decades parsing Canadian subtext, put it this way: \\*\\*_‘In Canadian English,’ she said, ‘sorry doesn’t always mean remorse—it often means, I acknowledge your presence and would like to avoid conflict.’_\\*\\*⁵\n\nAnd when delivered with a clipped “O” and the rhythm of a snowplow passing at 3 a.m., it might mean the exact opposite.\n\nThe sports bar was quiet by Game Four. Jays were up. No Reagan ad this time. Just the usual OLG lottery spots and a car commercial with snow tires.\n\nJason stirred his rye and Coke, glanced at the TV, and said to no one in particular, “Bet Trump still thinks the ad’s running.”\n\nTrevor snorted. “He probably made it his screensaver.”\n\nJason laughed. “O, sorry.”\n\nAnd again—he didn’t mean it.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
