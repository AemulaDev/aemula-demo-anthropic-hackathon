Michael Forbes had dropped it there the day before, clearing rocks from the field behind his farmhouse. He’d forgotten it the moment he set it down. But now, with the black SUVs crawling up the track again, the bucket felt newly charged, almost ceremonial, as if the land had arranged the scene itself.\n\nHe stepped outside, boots sinking into wet soil, and caught the smell that always arrived first: earth, salt, and the faint diesel of distant fishing boats. The wind from the North Sea pressed the grass flat. Forbes leaned on the door-frame and waited. When the passenger window lowered, the man inside didn’t bother warming the air.\n\n“Mr. Forbes, we’re back with a revised offer—one that reflects tremendous opportunity.”\n\nForbes didn’t move. “Aye? My answer hasn’t changed.”\n\n“Your neighbors want this,” the man said. Not a threat—just certainty. “Jobs. Growth. Prestige.”\n\nSome of them did. Forbes had heard it at the pub: a hotelier murmuring that a world-class course could revive the region; a young mechanic hoping for steady work. Their hopes weren’t foolish—they were trying to stay afloat. But Forbes knew the cost behind the promise. “Opportunity” sounded different when it required erasing the land beneath your own feet.\n\nHe lifted one of the stones from the bucket, felt the cold press into his palm, and let it drop. Another clunk.\n\n_**“He thinks I’ll just lie down,”**_ he’d said weeks earlier, _**“but I’m no’ moving for somebody building a playground.”**_\n\nTrump had arrived in Scotland back in 2006 with a developer’s swagger and a financier’s vocabulary. According to local officials who attended the early meetings, he spoke of the Menie dunes as “raw land,” as if the ancient, shifting ridge line were simply a stubborn blueprint awaiting his approval.¹ In the renderings he unfurled, the dunes flattened into tidy geometry. Homes disappeared. Foot-paths dissolved. The wild coastline rearranged itself to accommodate his signature.\n\nSome villagers welcomed him; others felt history stirring beneath their ribs. The dunes—one of the last major mobile systems in Europe—weren’t just scenic. They were alive. But in Trump’s team memos, they were “terrain.”²\n\nThen came the phrase that changed everything: compulsory purchase. Eminent domain. And with it, the feeling that something old and dangerous had been stirred. A fisherman stood up in a town hall and shouted, “We’ve seen this before. We called it the Clearances.”³ The room fell into a hush edged with fury.\n\nEven Trump’s project director, Neil Hobday, began to recoil. The pressure. The expectation that hold-outs could be forced out. The casual talk about “removing obstacles.” Years later, when reporters asked him why he quit, he answered plainly:\n\n_**“It became unreasonable for a foreign developer to force out families who’d lived there for generations.”**_\n\nHobday walked. Bulldozers rolled in anyway. By 2020, according to Scotland’s own environmental agency, the dunes had deteriorated so badly under the resort’s footprint that they no longer met criteria for protection.⁴ Trump called it progress. Forbes called it destruction.\n\nFor a while, the wind carried the story away—until the pattern resurfaced across the sea.\n\nDoughmore Beach in western Ireland smells different: sea-weed, peat smoke, and the mineral tang of the Atlantic. When Trump bought the Doonbeg resort in 2014, some locals welcomed him. A few pubs even hung up photos of his helicopter overhead. For families who’d watched jobs disappear for decades, investment meant hope.\n\nBut storms kept eating at the coast, and Trump’s company proposed a two-mile seawall of boulders and concrete to stop the Atlantic from reclaiming the fairways. Planning documents filed with Irish authorities—reviewed by journalists at the time—acknowledged rising seas and increased storm intensity as a threat.⁵ Publicly, Trump dismissed climate change as “nonsense.”\n\nThe contradiction unsettled the village.\n\nFisherman Liam O’Brien pointed at the dunes. “These fed us,” he said. “Cockles. Clams. You kill the dunes, you kill the beach.”\n\nA teacher at a planning hearing warned: “A wall is final. The coast isn’t. It moves. You cannot hold it still without breaking it.”\n\nIreland’s national appeals board rejected the wall in 2020, citing environmental harm.⁶ The village celebrated so loudly that, according to locals, you could hear the cheering down the coast. But the resort returned with smaller, “soft-engineering” proposals. The pressure continued—gentler, but constant.\n\nLike in Menie, Trump’s instinct wasn’t to live with the land. It was to fix it into a shape that suited him.\n\nWhich is why the Washington chapter never surprised Forbes when he heard it years later.\n\nThe Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue doesn’t smell like sea or peat. It smells of stone dust, recycled air, and the quiet gravity of a national landmark. Trump won the lease in 2013 to redevelop the federally-owned building. The contract, as watchdog groups repeatedly noted, barred elected officials from benefiting.⁷ But when he became president, he declared himself in compliance and kept the hotel. Foreign delegations booked suites. Lobbyists treated the bar like a back-channel.\n\nIt was Menie, rendered in marble.\n\nAnd when he returned to power, that instinct didn’t just shrink—it globalized. His advisers floated “post-conflict redevelopment opportunities” in Gaza’s devastated coastal strip (according to regional media). Venezuelan officials have publicly boasted of outreach to Trump-aligned investors for “strategic infrastructure partnerships” (as reported). Colombian property developers have talked—off the record—about foreign interest in new luxury enclaves along the Caribbean coast.\n\nNothing signed. But the pattern was unmistakable: beaches as blank canvases; borders as invitations; destabilised land as development gold.\n\nThen there was the White House—the nation’s most symbolic public space—where Trump tore into the East Wing during his second term. According to preservation officials who spoke anonymously to reporters, historic rooms were gutted to make way for a ballroom moulded to his aesthetic. A century of architectural heritage vanished behind drywall. Critics called it a desecration. Trump called it “modernisation.”\n\nBy the time journalists returned to Forbes’s farm, the bucket still sat where he’d left it. Rust climbed its rim. Lichen softened the stones inside. He walked them around the fields, past the stone walls his father built one rock at a time, each one lifted from the same stubborn soil.\n\nHe pointed toward the course—the gaudy green under a grey Scottish sky.\n\nA gust rose—sand, soil, and the faint chemical tang of treated turf. Forbes stopped walking.\n\n“Hear that?” he said. “That’s the land telling you it’s not done yet.”\n\nHe picked up one stone—smooth, cold, older than any deed—and rolled it in his hand.\n\n_**“He thought you could buy this place,”**_ he said quietly. _**\\_“But the land will outlast any of us.”**_\n\nThe wind carried the words across the field, toward the dunes that once moved freely. Then farther—toward coasts and shore-lines now wrapped in new negotiations, places where Trump’s attention has turned, reported by media, toward “redevelopment potential.”\n\nAnd as Forbes let the stone fall back into the bucket, it landed with that same old sound:\n\na warning, a memory, a promise—\n\nthat the land remembers everything,\n\nand answers back in its own time.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
