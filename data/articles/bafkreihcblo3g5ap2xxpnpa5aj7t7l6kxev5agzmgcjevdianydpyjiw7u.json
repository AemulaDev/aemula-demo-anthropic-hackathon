The band plays a slurred Charleston in D minor. Champagne foams in the glass. And somewhere beneath the mirrored ceiling of the Grand Ballroom, Donald J. Trump raises a toast to the crash.\n\nIt’s October 31, 2025 — Halloween. But there are no ghouls at this party. Just power brokers in Gatsby drag, lobbyists in tails, women in 1920s silhouettes, and a man at the center who has somehow turned spectacle into statecraft. Outside the gates, headlines blare: _Day 31 of the Federal Shutdown. SNAP Deadline Hours Away._ Inside, the joke is that the crash never happens.\n\n“If they’re hungry,” Trump says earlier in the week, “they should have voted better.”¹\n\nIt isn’t a mistake that he throws a party that night. It’s the point.\n\n**“He doesn’t celebrate in spite of the suffering. The suffering is the celebration.”**\n\nMaria Gonzales hasn’t had a paycheck in five weeks.\n\nIn the breakroom at Terminal C, Reagan National, the donated snacks are down to raisins and powdered creamer. The only sound besides the vending machine’s rattle is CNN on mute, rolling footage of empty congressional hallways and delayed flights.\n\nForty-three dollars. A bag of peanut-butter crackers. That’s the week.\n\nShe’s one of 900,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay during the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The reason? Democrats refuse to fund the government unless Trump extends ACA subsidies for healthcare, a policy lifeline. Trump refuses. The real reason isn’t ideology. It’s control.\n\n“He doesn’t negotiate,” says a senior Senate staffer. “He waits for you to bleed out, then decides whether it amuses him to let you up.”²\n\n**“Not narcissism — strategic sadism.”**\n\nSNAP benefits are hours from cutoff. Military families line up at food pantries. OMB drafts reduction-in-force orders: permanent layoffs. Trump sees all of it and smiles. On Halloween night, while Rachel in Kansas packs her third tote from the Stronghold Food Pantry³, Trump stands under imported crystal and calls the shutdown “a masterpiece.” Someone laughs too loudly, the way people do when they know they shouldn’t.\n\nThe party has a name: **The Crash Never Happened.**\n\nGuests are told to dress like survivors who got richer. The champagne coupes have gold-leaf rims. The cake is shaped like a bull market, its horns gilded and its belly hollow.\n\nWhen asked if the optics concern him, Trump leans back and says, “They should be grateful I’m not billing them for the show.”\n\nFor him, the shutdown isn’t failure. It’s theater. The government stops paying people; he fills the stage with sequins. The pain isn’t a byproduct. It’s the price of admission.\n\nTrump doesn’t merely tolerate suffering. He uses it. Maybe enjoys it more than he knows.\n\nDr. Justin Frank, in _Trump on the Couch,_ writes that humiliation, not persuasion, is Trump’s preferred instrument.⁴ His niece Mary Trump, a psychologist, calls him someone raised to believe that “empathy is weakness, and cruelty gets rewarded.”⁵ Others go further. “He doesn’t hurt people to feel powerful,” says Dr. Bandy Lee. “He hurts them to remind you that only he can stop the pain.”⁶\n\nThe shutdown becomes his experiment. Will the public blame him? Will Democrats cave? Will federal workers crack? Will the lights still look good on camera?\n\n**“He turns a national crisis into a lighting test.”**\n\nThe second party is quieter.\n\nNo banner this time, just a press embargo. A few nights after the Gatsby gala, with SNAP offices bracing for chaos and TSA officers calling in sick en masse, Trump throws a _Tribute to Liberty_ dinner by the pool. The centerpiece? Thirteen women in flag-themed swimsuits performing synchronized routines under red-white-blue floodlights.\n\nSousa blares over speakers. The water ripples like taut silk. The swimmers salute. The guests clap. Trump sits in a high-backed chair beside a bronze fountain shaped like an eagle. He doesn’t clap. He just watches.\n\nThe routines end with a flourish: each woman floating backward into the shape of a Liberty Bell. A staffer snaps a photo for his Truth Social account. It’s captioned, _“America is Beautiful. Shutdown is Fake News.”_\n\n“When I throw a party,” he once said, “I make it a punishment if you weren’t invited.”⁷\n\nOutside the compound, federal workers choose between medicine and rent. Inside the pool, flags glisten. Water curves in synchronized arcs. One swimmer’s cap slips; no one seems to notice.\n\n**“While they starve, he stages a pageant.”**\n\nThere’s a long history of rulers who turn cruelty into performance.\n\nMussolini holds rallies choreographed to exact shadows. Ceaușescu makes schoolchildren sing in triple harmony while their parents starve. Saddam forces prisoners to clap for their executioners. The dictator’s goal is always the same: to disorient the public into accepting grandeur as governance.\n\nTrump’s parties belong to that lineage, not in scale but in intent. To declare dominion not through law but through spectacle. To say, _While you suffer, I shimmer. While you beg, I build a ballroom._ It’s a form of pleasure that political scientists struggle to describe. It isn’t policy; it’s presentation. _Look what I can do to them. And they still can’t touch me._\n\n“For Trump, the pain of others is a stage prop,” says Jeff Sachs. “The more it accumulates, the more the room reflects him.”⁸\n\nOn day 41, the Democrats break.\n\nSenator Angus King leads a bipartisan group to accept a short-term budget deal. The government reopens through January. Three agencies — VA/Military Construction, Agriculture, and the Legislative Branch — get full-year funding. Everyone else gets a Band-Aid.\n\nThe ACA subsidy? Deferred. A promised vote in December. No enforcement. No leverage. No guarantee.\n\nDemocrats call the deal necessary because workers are suffering, airports unsafe, shutdowns cruel. All true. Which makes it worse.\n\n“You don’t declare a hostage crisis,” says Sen. Bernie Sanders, “and then give the kidnapper a gift card.”⁹\n\nTrump gets everything he wants: no concessions, no subsidies, no shared blame. And most importantly, the narrative. Even when he brings the government to its knees, they still crawl back\n\n***\n\nMaria will get her paycheck in December. It will barely cover her back rent. Her ACA premiums will double. She’ll cancel her health plan. Her son, who needs asthma meds, will rely on urgent-care visits. He wheezes at night, the sound small and deliberate as a clock.\n\nShe plans to leave her TSA badge in the envelope it arrived in. She’ll take the job at the pharmacy — fewer hours, less pay, but at least the doors stay open when Congress loses a bet.\n\nHer pantry will still hold the peanut butter; her son will still wheeze through the nights. The next shutdown rumors gather like clouds behind her eyes.\n\nLast night she saw footage of the synchronized swimmers again, this time in a _Stephen Colbert_ montage. She turned the TV off.\n\n“That pool? That flag? That isn’t for America,” she says. “That’s him watching us drown.”\n\nShe left the TV dark and whispered, “Not again.”\n\nSomewhere in Florida, another party is already being planned. There always is.\n\n***\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\. ABC News. “Trump Hosted ‘Gatsby’ Party Hours Before Shutdown’s SNAP Deadline.” November 2, 2025.
