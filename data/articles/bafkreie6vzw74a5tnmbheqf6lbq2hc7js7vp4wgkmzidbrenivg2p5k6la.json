  "body": "I'm Zach Elwood. I write about political polarization and how we might build a less toxic, less divisive society. I'm the author of \"Defusing American Anger\" and \"How Contempt Destroys Democracy,\" and I'm the host of the psychology podcast People Who Read People.\n\n***\n\nI’ve heard few ideas that I see as truly revolutionary and visionary when it comes to trying to solve our toxic polarization problem. Don Templeman’s Aemula project is one of the few that come to mind.\n\nNo matter your politics, if you’re interested in reducing toxic polarization and politics-based contempt, I recommend signing up to Aemula. If you’re curious what the “big idea” is, and want to see why I say Aemula is revolutionary in concept, you can watch this visual walkthrough of Aemula and its principles that I did with Templeman recently. Templeman shows how Aemula uses social network analysis (SNA) to map the relationships between readers and content creators, and the idea behind how he uses that information to reduce content/audience fracturing/polarization. I think it’s a fun and educational exploration of his idea, and you’ll also learn about SNA, which is used by many social media platforms to understand their users/audience.\n\n{{youtube:xkbEpCt67tY}}\n\nFor a transcript of this talk and links to the episode on audio platforms, [go here](https://behavior-podcast.com/a-news-site-using-social-network-analysis-to-disincentivize-polarized-content/).\n\n***\n\nTo learn about my books on polarization, see <https://american-anger.com>, or see my Substack at <https://defusingamericananger.substack.com>.",
