Burnt Jacket Mountain gave off that unmistakable smell of old lumber warming in thin sunlight, a resin-sweet breath rising from the forest floor. Beverly Burgess caught it before she caught sight of anything else. She always led with her nose; her son used to say she could smell November before the calendar did.\n\nShe walked up the turnout expecting the usual narrow gap in the trees. Instead she stopped short. A new steel gate sealed the entrance, the paint still factory-clean. Sunlight bounced off its polished bars in sharp little flashes. A sign—TRAIL CLOSED – PRIVATE PROPERTY—hung stiffly, as if someone had bolted it on in a hurry. Beverly touched the gate the way a person touches a forehead in doubt, half-hoping the metal wouldn’t feel as cold as it looked. Later she told a reporter she didn’t know “why or for what purpose” the land had been bought, only that the closure “saddened residents and caused concern for local businesspeople.”¹⁴ But her private reaction was smaller and heavier: “This doesn’t feel right.”\n\nAcross the cove, Nancy Thorne and Don Campbell were already up. Don rinsed the coffee filter with habitual care. Nancy stepped in clutching her phone like bad news. “They blocked it,” she said. They didn’t need to specify what “it” was.\n\nBy midmorning they stood at the gate themselves. Frost had melted into tiny glass beads on the branches, catching the light like scattered sequins. Machinery hummed deeper in the woods—contractors trenching cable lines, cutting new scars into the soil. Nancy stared past the bars as if expecting an old timber-company foreman to appear and give an explanation. Nothing moved but the drifting meltwater.\n\n“Should’ve brought gloves,” she murmured. With Nancy, practicality was always the first layer over hurt.\n\nRumor beat the facts to the general store. Someone guessed a tech billionaire. Someone else scoffed. A third muttered, “These days they buy anything.” But the truth was stranger. Burnt Jacket Mountain—its trail, its shoreline, its 1,423.7 acres—hadn’t been bought by a person at all. It now belonged to two Delaware companies: Burnt Jacket Holding I, LLC and Burnt Jacket Holding II, LLC.¹¹² No neighbor. No handshake. Just capital letters and an out-of-state address. In a place where people still wave to every passing truck, anonymity felt less like privacy and more like a door slammed softly and permanently shut.\n\nNancy took it personally. She and Don had maintained the trail for years—clearing brush, repainting blazes, shaping stone steps after storms. Long before anyone knew the owner’s name, she’d salvaged the summit logbooks from the wooden box at the top, afraid construction crews might throw them out. Back home, the books smelled of damp paper and balsam. They overflowed with voices: children scribbling “I hate hiking,” honeymooners marking Perfect Maine Day #2, a careful entry from a man scattering his grandmother’s ashes—she’d climbed the mountain in 1918, and three generations had followed her.\n\nThat night, with Don feeding the fire, Nancy ran her hand over the pages. These weren’t just notes. They were evidence that the public had walked this mountain openly and continuously for decades—possibly enough for a prescriptive-easement case.⁹⁶ But the thought didn’t bring relief. It brought a quiet grief that something as simple as walking uphill now required an argument.\n\nMeanwhile, the new owner’s intentions took shape. Permit filings outlined a 4,000-foot driveway curling deep into the peninsula, nearly 12,700 feet of buried electrical lines,⁸⁰ and a secluded residence shielded from all sides. Not a camp. A compound designed to stay unseen.\n\nSteve Yocom at Destination Moosehead Lake tried to stay measured. Burnt Jacket, he said, had long been a “locals’ gem,” a dependable trail used “time and time again.”⁶¹ But even he admitted privately he no longer knew what to tell visitors. The big laminated map behind his desk—its trail network branching across Moosehead like arteries—now had a dead end where Burnt Jacket once offered a quick, friendly climb.\n\nThe regional pressure had been building for years. Home prices in Greenville had jumped more than 75 percent in a short span.²⁸³ Lakefront camps that once sold for $350,000 now broke the million-dollar threshold. The people who kept the region alive—teachers, carpenters, lodge workers—were being nudged toward the outskirts of the place they’d sustained. So when an anonymous buyer took an entire peninsula, it didn’t feel like a sale. It felt like a forecast.\n\nOn the state’s books, the only “person” who bought Burnt Jacket is a Delaware shell company.\n\nInto that vacuum stepped the rumor: Mark Zuckerberg. It spread because the silence was large enough to accommodate it. The Moosehead Lakeshore Journal traced the Burnt Jacket LLCs to the same Delaware registered agent used by several Zuckerberg-linked entities.⁴³ The reporter didn’t call it evidence—only said it “does little to dismiss” the speculation.¹⁵² For a community used to knowing who built which garage in ’94, the idea of a billionaire hiding behind initials felt less far-fetched than the idea that no one was hiding at all.\n\nCarla Ritchie of the land trust tried to keep the ground from sliding too far. She drafted careful letters asking for a meeting, reminding the new owner—whoever they were—that the region’s culture and economy depended on shared access and shared trust.⁷⁴⁸ But formality can’t pry open a door meant to stay shut.\n\nThen came April. Mud everywhere. Lake light coloring the water copper at dawn. Nancy opened the oldest logbook again. The pages smelled of pine pitch and fog. She paused on the ashes entry and rested her hand there, imagining the man who wrote it believing mountains outlast ownership, paperwork, secrecy.\n\nBehind the locked gate, the ridge still caught morning light the way it always had—quiet, angled, indifferent. Pines still leaned toward one another in their familiar cathedral. The scent of resin still drifted across the trailhead like an invitation waiting for someone with the right memory to accept it.\n\nThat evening, Beverly stepped outside her lodge, flour still clinging to her apron. The lake lay flat as pewter. The mountain stood in silhouette. She watched the ridgeline and whispered, “I just hope this isn’t how it ends.” She wasn’t talking about the trail. She was talking about the meaning of the place.\n\nAnd still the scent of pine rises every morning, slipping through the bars of the new gate. Whether it leads back to the ridge or stops cold at the metal line remains the part of the mountain no deed, permit, or LLC can decide.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
