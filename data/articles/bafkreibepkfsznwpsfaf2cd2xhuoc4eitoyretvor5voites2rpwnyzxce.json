Tom breaks down why awareness is the missing link — and how media can be used for good instead of division.\n\n**🧱 From Dialogue to Results**\nTalking matters — but results matter more. This conversation digs into why conservatives, moderates, and everyday citizens need to _see_ outcomes to buy in.\n\n**🤝 Belonging Over Outrage**\nAt the core of polarization is a broken sense of belonging. Tom and Wilk explore how fear, grievance, and loneliness fill the vacuum when shared narratives disappear.\n\n**📖 Storytelling That Scales Hope**\nOutrage wins attention — but hope, surprise, and great storytelling win trust. This episode shows how bridge-building can compete without becoming propaganda.\n\n***\n\n### 👤 About the Guest\n\n**Tom Fishman** is a founding partner of the Builders Movement, an advisor to the ProHuman Foundation, and a seasoned media and technology leader.
