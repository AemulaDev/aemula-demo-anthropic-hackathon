Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nLast Thursday, my accounting professor let me out of class about 15 minutes early. For most professors, that’s a daily occurrence. In accounting, it’s a once-per-semester miracle. On top of that, at the closest dining hall, I got in line just as the pizza came out of the oven. It was sliced right as I reached the counter, and reminded me of how simple moments can be a bonus to my day.\n\nLast week in _“[The Only Portfolio Most Investors Actually Need](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/the-only-portfolio-most-investors?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share\\&utm_medium=web)”_, we covered the essential holdings for a beginner investor and how they compound wealth to massive levels over time. This week, we’re talking about a small but impactful add-on you can make to your financial life that helps fund that core portfolio. Debit card cashback.\n\nCredit cards aren’t for everyone. Maybe you don’t like the idea of spending money you don’t already have, or you prefer to keep things simple. Either way, debit cards can be a smart way to earn rewards without stepping into credit card territory.\n\nCashback debit cards are checking account cards that pay you a percentage of your spending back in cash. Instead of borrowing like a credit card, you’re spending your own money, and the bank shares part of the interchange fee it earns each time your card is used. While cashback usually lives in the credit card world, some debit cards are real diamonds in the rough.\n\nMost cashback debit programs sit around 1%, often with minimum balance requirements or other conditions. A straightforward card that works for you is rare. However, the Discover debit card I recently obtained gives you a clean 1% cashback on every purchase, with no fees.\n\nAlong with that, you get access to over 60,000 fee-free ATMs across the U.S., no monthly maintenance fees, no minimum transaction requirements, no overdraft fees, and no minimum balance. The account also works with Zelle peer-to-peer transfers. It is easy to set up entirely online, and it took me about 15 minutes start to finish, including my first $25 transfer.\n\nAnd yes, 1% up to $3,000 a month in purchases seems like nothing to write home about. It’s not flashy, but getting paid for purchases you intended to make anyway is impossible to ignore.\n\nAlthough other debit cards offer cashback, like the Affinity Cashback card and the Venmo debit card, they often have minimum deposit or balance requirements, or, in the case of Venmo, only work with select partners and broad categories.\n\nAnother choice I have at the front of my wallet is the PayPal Cash Back Debit Card, which offers 5% back on up to $1,000 in purchases per month in a category of your choice.\n\nI use PayPal as my go-to payment hub for eating out. My weekly restaurant budget is automatically deposited into a PayPal Savings account, currently earning 3.5% annual interest through PayPal’s partner bank, Synchrony. Those savings fuel my dining category and slowly deplete while still earning interest. It’s simple, flexible, and government-insured by the FDIC.\n\nDebit cashback doesn’t replace credit card rewards. Credit cards still win on raw reward rates, but by combining both systems to achieve a higher blended rate, you can help yourself keep more of your hard-earned dollars.\n\nLet’s run through a quick scenario, shall we? You’re running $1,000 in monthly spending, groceries, gas, subscriptions, and random doodads, through a 1% cashback card. That spits out $10 per month. You invest every dollar into [The Core Portfolio](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/the-only-portfolio-most-investors?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share\\&utm_medium=web), which compounds at a 12% CAGR. Slowly, you build up contributions, and over the course of a year, you contribute $120.\n\nFrom age 20 to 60, you make 480 monthly deposits of $10. Your total contributions over four decades amount to just $4,800. That is less than one semester of living on campus–– and that’s in today’s dollars! The magic is not in the contributions; it’s in the power of compounded growth over time.\n\nAt a 12% CAGR compounded monthly for 40 years, those $10 deposits grow to approximately $118,000. Real returns will vary; this is simply an example of compounding in action, but you get the idea.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3GTO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b2ef48-9c42-4d4e-946f-b1a4513552fe_1024x1215.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3GTO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b2ef48-9c42-4d4e-946f-b1a4513552fe_1024x1215.png)\n\n{{caption:A $1,000 monthly spending habit steadily builds a six-figure portfolio.}}\n\nSpeaking of Discover, a recent update worth mentioning is that the quarterly 5% cashback categories on the Discover It credit card include grocery stores, streaming services, and wholesale clubs. Costco doesn’t qualify because it only accepts Visa, but Sam’s Club does. That’s a big win for grocery runs.\n\nIt’s less helpful for gas purchases, since Sam’s Club gas pumps are coded as gas stations, not wholesale clubs. But you can buy a Sam’s Club gift card with your Discover card, earn 5%, and use it later for gas. Sam’s also sells discounted gift cards for other retailers, which you can stack with the 5% cashback for even better deals.\n\nNot every minute-saving or optimization strategy is worth it for everyone. Your time has value. But setting up automated systems to capture an extra percent or two can be worth it, because small numbers over a long time add up to huge ones.\n\nI’m going to keep enjoying the extra layers and small wins today. The kind you don’t have to think about once they’re set up. Fresh pizza after class. Cashback showing up in the background. Nothing life-changing, just small bonuses that make the day a little better without asking for extra effort. And if tomorrow morning’s coffee is fresh too, great, although it’ll probably be lukewarm by the time I roll out of bed.\n\n_Got questions, disagreements, or a money topic you want broken down next?_\n\n_Shoot me an email at_ _<Crawford@awmfinancial.net>_ _or visit awmfinancial.net._\n\n_This content is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.
