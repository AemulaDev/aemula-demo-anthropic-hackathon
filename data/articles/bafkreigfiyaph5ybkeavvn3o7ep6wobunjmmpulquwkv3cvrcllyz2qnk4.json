Within days, regulators from Washington to Zurich were scrambling to plug the holes and convince the world the banking system wasn’t collapsing in on itself._\n\nThe Federal Reserve intervened by creating the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to support remaining banks. The program allowed banks to borrow from the Fed, using Treasurys, mortgage-backed bonds, and other debt as collateral, preventing a recurrence of the SVB scenario until the program’s one-year end.\n\nOn March 13th, President Biden reassured the nation that the banking system was stable, ensuring that all depositors, including those above the $250,000 limit, could access their funds. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations commenced, and The Fed began reviewing regulations for mid-sized banks. Bank stocks rebounded as investors believed the crisis was abating, even for First Republic, which had been hit hardest the previous week.\n\nThe situation became international when the European bank Credit Suisse experienced a mild bank run, causing its stock price to plummet to an all-time low. Other European banks like Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank were dragged down. Swiss regulators intervened, providing Credit Suisse with a $53 billion loan to restore confidence and meet withdrawal requests.\n\n_The rescue efforts bought time, but confidence once shaken is never easily restored. In the conclusion next week, we’ll see how the shockwaves from SVB’s collapse kept rippling through the system long after the headlines faded._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
