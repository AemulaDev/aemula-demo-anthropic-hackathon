Many people even rush into marriage, figuring they’ll divorce later anyway, a tragic ending for one of God’s greatest gifts to mankind.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NP9p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6a86c64-04aa-4d58-a102-62551d061fc6_1536x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NP9p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6a86c64-04aa-4d58-a102-62551d061fc6_1536x1024.png)\n\n**Romans 7:1-2 (NIV)**\n\n_Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?_ _For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him._\n\nRomans 7 opens with a principle that grounds the entire chapter: we are released by the law, but still bound in Christ. In verses 1–3, Paul uses marriage as the illustration. A woman is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from that marriage contract and is free to remarry. Death changes legal status.\n\n**Romans 7:3 (NIV)**\n\n_So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man._\n\nPaul then applies this logic spiritually. In the same way that death releases a spouse from marriage, dying to our old selves releases us from being governed by the written law.\n\nWe are no longer ruled by external commands, but we are now governed by the Holy Spirit who resides within us. This does not mean the law is wrong or sinful. On the contrary, the law is good. It provides earthly clarity, structure, and guidance for daily life.\n\nThe danger comes when the law replaces Christ. We must be careful not to become worshipers of the law itself, elevating doctrine, structure, or rule-keeping above Jesus. The law is spiritual, but we are not. That tension sits at the heart of Romans 7.\n\n**Romans 7:15 (NIV)**\n\n_I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do._\n\nBeginning in verse 15, Paul becomes intensely personal. He admits a reality that feels uncomfortably familiar: his actions do not align with his desires. He writes that he does not understand what he does, because what he wants to do, he does not do, and what he hates, he ends up doing instead. This is not the confession of a weak believer, but of a mature one who understands the depth of his sin.\n\nI also struggle with doing things I know will negatively impact me, if not now, then more so down the road, as I’m sure everyone can relate to, if they’re honest with themselves. And yet I keep on sinning and hurting my body, my soul, and other people.\n\n**Romans 7:19 (NIV)**\n\n_For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing._\n\nPaul goes further in verse 19, stating that he does not do the good he wants to do, but instead keeps doing the evil he does not want to do. It is painfully accurate. Paul recognizes that good does not naturally dwell within him. His sinful nature remains active, even as his desires have changed. This acknowledgment leads him to humility rather than despair. He does not excuse his sin, but he also does not pretend that self-discipline alone can save him.\n\nBy the end of the chapter, Paul calls himself wretched and makes it clear that salvation can only come through Jesus Christ. He notes that while his mind is a slave to God’s law, his flesh remains enslaved to sin. This tension explains why the Christian life feels like a battle. Salvation does not remove the struggle, but it changes who ultimately holds authority.\n\n**Matthew 19:8 (NIV)**\n\n_Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.”_\n\nRomans 7:1–3 also aligns closely with Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 19:8 regarding marriage and remarriage. Marriage remains binding while both partners are alive, and only death dissolves the covenant. This same principle appears again in 1 Corinthians 7, where Paul discusses exceptions such as infidelity.\n\nThat same logic applies spiritually. The laws that govern us are dependent on whether we are alive to sin or dead to it. Just as death releases a spouse from marriage, dying to our old selves releases us from being ruled by the law as a means of righteousness.\n\nThank God for grace. God understands our relationship with sin and sent His Son because, without Christ, we would be utterly lost. As Paul makes clear, we desire to live godly lives and yet continue to sin. That does not mean we surrender to sin. It means we actively strive to put it to death. Over time, through sanctification, sin’s power over us weakens.\n\nThrough Christ, we have been saved and are now slaves to righteousness rather than slaves to sin. The enemy wants us trapped in shame, isolated by our failures. God invites us to run toward Him in repentance and grace instead. We can only be bound to one master at a time, whether that is the law, sin, or righteousness. We cannot obtain righteousness if we commit ourselves to sin or to the law as a substitute for Christ.\n\nJesus did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it completely. Our daily sins do not exhaust God’s grace. His mercy is infinite and continually renewing. The Spirit walks with us, not for us. If we are truly saved and the Spirit dwells within us, good works will naturally follow. Our works do not save us, but our salvation will shape our actions.\n\n**1 Corinthians 11:12 (NIV)**\n\n_For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God._\n\nPaul reinforces this idea elsewhere. In 1 Corinthians 11:12, he reminds us that outward appearances and customs were part of the old covenant law. While some of these practices still offer wisdom, they are no longer requirements for salvation. God’s grace stands above human structures, and arguments over man-made rules often do more harm than good.\n\n**Matthew 5:17 (NIV)**\n\n_Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them._\n\nJesus makes this clear in Matthew 15 when He rebukes the Pharisees for obsessing over food laws while ignoring the condition of the heart. What defiles a person is not external, but internal. Heart posture matters more than rigid adherence to earthly customs.\n\nSo how can the struggles depicted in Romans 7 guide us in overcoming personal sin? For me, Paul’s honesty is deeply encouraging. His struggles transcend time, culture, and circumstance. We are all fighting similar battles. Despite his failures, Paul maintained strong faith and modeled genuine repentance. His humility reminds us that sanctification is a lifelong process and that striving for Christlikeness requires continual surrender rather than perfection.\n\nStudying Romans 7 has reminded me that my shortcomings don’t disqualify me from God’s plans, but they do reveal my need for grace. Whether preparing for marriage someday or simply striving for obedience now, I don’t need perfection; I need Christ.\n\n_In the meantime, I’ll be praying for purity of heart, mind, and spirit. Until next time:_\n\n**“That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.” —Genesis 2:24 (NIV)**\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
