  "body": "Courage is one of those words we use a lot, but rarely slow down to define.\n\nMost of us grow up believing that some people are just _brave_, and others aren’t. That courage is a personality trait. Something you’re either born with or you’re not.\n\nWhat if that’s wrong?\n\nWhat if fear and courage are both learned?\n\n{{youtube:0RadxaVIAjk}}\n\nIn this moment from my conversation with Julie Lavender Le Doux, she names something simple and deeply important:\nfear is learned — and so is bravery.\n\nAvoidance teaches fear where to grow.\nPractice teaches courage how to show up.\n\nIn my work with Braver Angels, we talk a lot about _courageous citizenship_. Not the loud kind. Not the performative kind. But the quiet, daily courage it takes to stay human when it would be easier to withdraw.\n\nCalling someone instead of firing off a text.\nStaying in a hard conversation instead of walking away.\nSetting a boundary instead of disappearing.\nChoosing curiosity when fear would rather write the story.\n\nJulie says something else that matters just as much: **you don’t have to do this alone**. Courage can be taught. Mentored. Even shepherded when conflict feels overwhelming.\n\nThat matters — because none of us were meant to face fear in isolation.\n\nThe question isn’t whether fear shows up.\nIt always does.\n\nThe question is: **what are we practicing in response to it?**\n\n🎧 If you’d like to hear the full conversation with Julie Lavender Le Doux — where we talk about fear, courage, imagination, and raising resilient humans — the complete episode of _Derate The Hate_ is available wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nAnd if you’re willing to sit with it for a moment:\n\n**What’s one small thing courage might be asking of you right now?**",
