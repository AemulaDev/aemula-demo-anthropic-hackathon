The first is a giant bargain bin filled with fall decor, ranging from fake pumpkins to oversized skeletons. The second is an atrocious display of wonderful Christmas spirit. The snowmen. The candy canes. The massive inflatable Santas. The overwhelming Christmas consumerism is already in full force by the start of fall.\n\nAlthough pumpkin spice lattes are sold in August, which is already blasphemous to the seasons, selling Christmas in September is even worse. Kevin McAllister’s “winter” vacation does not go so well when it is ninety-five degrees and sunny outside.\n\nHowever, that may be a southern specialty, because even during winter, it is likely still in the sixties. As a part-time procrastinator, I need the Halloween staples to stay on shelves until the literal minute of Halloween, not disappear before the pumpkins hit the porches.\n\nEven on November 1, it is still not time to celebrate Christmas, as tempting as it may be. It is crucial not to overlook the joys of a family dinner giving thanks together and the potential for lively political conversation. Just kidding. No family ever argues on Thanksgiving.\n\nBetter to watch the Macy’s parade, throw a football around until you get bored, and go to bed early when the food coma strikes, because when you wake up on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, it is finally Christmas time. Put on Mariah Carey, let the bells ring, and watch the stereotypical Hallmark Christmas couple accidentally fall in love in the cornfields of Iowa.\n\nJust like a warm crackling fire needs air to breathe, so do the festivities. Let Halloween and Thanksgiving have their moments and enjoy the celebrations that accompany them. Get fat on Halloween candy, lose a few pounds in the corn maze, then gain them back over turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes.\n\nDo not miss those moments by consuming peppermint lattes before the proper time. There is plenty of pumpkin spice before that train ends and the gravy one begins.\n\nBy starting Christmas after Labor Day, you dilute the quality of the season because it is no longer a special event. Why bother getting excited with anticipation when Christmas lasts a fourth of the year?\n\nAlthough I can pack away plenty of gingerbread cookies, hot chocolate, and candy canes, anyone who has woken up with a sore stomach knows that too much of a good thing can end in disaster. So it is with the Christmas season.\n\nEnjoy the moment. Savor the wild swings in weather from light snow flurries one day to upper seventies the next in November. Notice the leaves changing and falling in the month of October. Accept the annoyance of school starting up in September. Live in the moment and remember where you are.\n\nHowever, in all seriousness, take the time to enjoy your family, friends, and loved ones: Merry Christmas and a happy Valentine’s Day!\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
