  "body": "A disclaimer: This write-up is entirely for Christians. If you’re not a believer or at least familiar with the Bible, you may find this argument unpersuasive, and it may contain terms that are confusing or that you don’t fully understand. To secular audiences, I usually make a much more utilitarian argument for loving your enemies. This is not a utilitarian argument.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I presented a Braver Angels workshop called “Depolarizing Ourselves” at a church in the Seattle area and had an unsettling experience. This workshop is designed for religious audiences, and the opening and closing inserts for this specific event were designed with a Protestant Christian audience in mind.\n\nPart of the way through, an attendee read a Robert Jones Jr. quote (which they misattributed to James Baldwin): “We can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist,” and then asked, “How can we depolarize in light of this?”\n\nWhile I’m regularly asked some version of this question in secular circles, I was horrified to hear it asked at a church. Worse, when I said, “Jesus calls us to love our neighbors, not just the ones that make us feel comfy and bake us brownies,” a pastor followed up with, “Well, in this church, we believe that marginalized people are less safe to stand up for themselves, and it’s up to people with privilege to love their neighbors for them.”\n\nOof… friends, when I say I gave a sermon…\n\nThen, this week on X (formerly Twitter), discourse on friends and enemies has heated up again, with people arguing over how and whether to engage Tucker Carlson (formerly a Fox News host and conservative stalwart, now an apologist for terrorists, racists, and authoritarians) and Nick Fuentes (self-described white supremacist).\n\nChristians are truly the people best prepared to answer the question of, “How shall I treat my enemies?” and should there be “no enemies to the right/left?” Jesus teaches us to “love \\[our] neighbor as \\[ourselves],” to “love \\[our] neighbor,” to “love \\[our] enemies,” to “do good to those who do evil to you,” and “bless those who curse you,” commands repeated throughout Scripture!\n\n> In Zechariah 8:17, God tells the Israelites, “**Do not plot evil in your hearts against your neighbor**, and do not love perjury, for I hate all this.”\n\n> In the Beattitudes in Matthew 5 and repeated in Luke 6, Jesus teaches his disciples, His closest followers:\n> \"**Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness**, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. **You are blessed when they insult you and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of me.**” (Matthew 5:10-12)\n\n> You have heard that it was said, “Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.” But I tell you, **love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.** … For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what are you doing out of the ordinary? Don’t even the Gentiles do the same? (Matthew 5:43 - 48)\n\n> He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: **Love your neighbor as yourself.**” (Matthew 22:37)\n\n> ”Which command is the most important of all?”\n> Jesus answered, “Listen, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. The second is, **love your neighbor as yourself.**” (Mark 12:28-31)\n\n> “But I say to you who listen: **Love your enemies, do what is good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.”** (Luke 6:27-28)\n\n> The commandments … are summed up by this commandment: **Love your neighbor as yourself**. (Romans 13:9)\n\n> We are not giving anyone an occasion for offense, so that the ministry will not be blamed. Instead, as God’s ministers, we commend ourselves in everything: **by great endurance, by afflictions, by hardships, by difficulties, by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times of hunger**, by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, by the word of truth, by the power of God; through weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, \\*\\*through glory and dishonor, through slander and good report; regarded as deceivers, yet true; as unknown, yet recognized; as dying, yet see—we live; as being disciplined, yet not killed; as grieving, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.\n> \\*\\*(2nd Corinthians 6:3-10)\n\n> For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement: \\*\\*Love your neighbor as yourself. (\\*\\*Galatians 5:14)\n\n> [I]f you fulfill the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, **love your neighbor as yourself**, you are doing well. (James 2:8)\n\nClearly, Christians are really supposed to care about loving their neighbors and their enemies. Also, “not giving anyone an occasion for offense” clearly doesn’t mean we are to avoid speaking truth that offends!\n\nLet’s talk about what it means to take this command seriously.\n\n1. **Jesus says to love your neighbor as you love yourself. To love your neighbor as yourself, you must actually love yourself.**\n   When I was young, this actually transformed my own inner voice, because I was my own worst critic. I loved others **more** than I loved myself. For others, I would change any plan I had to conform to their desires. I sacrificed work important to building my future for literally every whim of my parents. I called myself names and undermined my own abilities after any mistake, even as I gave friends and colleagues grace. A manager once looked at me and asked, mystified, as I muttered angry commentary about myself under my breath, “Why are you beating yourself up over this? You never make the same mistake twice, and you’ve already fixed it!” Finally, one day, a friend asked me, as she watched me once again curse myself for a minor imperfection: “Why do you give others so much grace and yourself so little? You would never treat others the way you treat yourself.” She was right… and over time, as a result of that one comment, I changed the way I treated myself. Sometimes, our disrespect and anger toward others is a failure to love at all, not just a failure to love our neighbors.\n\n2. Other times, we’re failing to love our neighbors as ourselves in the normal way— we assume the worst of others’ intent, but only see our own intent in a positive light. We imagine what our neighbors believe about politics, and then fear them, instead of asking them. We overread people’s votes for a candidate as being votes for our worst fears.\n\n   Maybe you believe the neighbor with a Trump sign is a transphobe. Have you ever knocked on their door and asked them what they think about trans issues? What if you were wrong? Maybe you believe the neighbor with a trans pride flag wants you dead. Have you ever knocked on their door and asked them what they think about trans issues? What if you were wrong? We fail to love our neighbors in the way we think they should love us. [Statistics teach us](https://moreincommonus.com/publication/shared-ideals-divergent-realities/) that we all have a LOT more in common with each other than we think.\n\n   Maybe your neighbor hasn’t thought through the things they’re saying… most people don’t. Recently, I talked with someone who started the conversation by saying that he thought Charlie Kirk deserved to die, but by the end of our conversation, 20 minutes later, expressed agreement with the exact point he’d just moments earlier said merited death. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken with who have said some version of, “Aren’t you angry about the genocide in Gaza?” and then, in conversation, shared some version of, “Well, I don’t know whether it’s legally a genocide… but so many people are dying!” Reaching past that initial soundbyte for clarifying questions is _incredibly_ important to accurately understanding people, including your neighbors.\n\n3. Now, let’s take the hard case: You knocked on your neighbor’s door. You asked the clarifying questions. \\*\\*He really does believe the Jews faked the Holocaust. She really does believe Hilary Clinton and other notable Democrats personally murdered babies. He really does think Jews orchestrated Charlie Kirk’s murder. She really does believe all Republicans should be hanged. He really does believe your marriage should be illegal. She really does believe elective abortion should be legal up to birth.\n\n   \\*\\*What does it mean to love this person you view as your enemy?\n   How did Jesus behave toward His enemies?\n\n   **He didn’t hesitate to truthfully call out people’s sin.**\n   To the Pharisees plotting to kill Him in Matthew 12:34, he says, “Brood of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.”\n\n   **He shared Passover with Judas, knowing Judas would betray Him.**\n   Matthew 26:20-25\n   When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.” They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?” Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.” Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said so.”\n\n   **He did not show partiality (loyalty), even to family.**\n   Matthew 12:46-50\n   While he was still speaking with the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.” He replied to the one who was speaking to him, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?” Stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! \\*\\*For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”\n   \\*\\*Family asking you to do wrong is not family in Christ.\n\n   **And yet He ate with the people who were considered the most deceitful and immoral in society.**\n   Matthew 9:10-13\n   While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” On hearing this, Jesus said, “**It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.**”\n\n   While we are told to break fellowship with people claiming to be Christians who are actively “sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or verbally abusive, a drunkard or a swindler.” (1 Corinthians 5:11), Paul explicitly clarifies in verse 10, “I did not mean the immoral people of this world or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters; otherwise you would have to leave the world.” I would argue that, as Tucker Carlson and Nick Fuentes are both calling themselves Christians and openly abusing the Bible to justify their hatred for Israel and Jews and their partiality for white people, following 1 Corinthians means putting both of these men out of any church they attend, if they attend a church, allowing them to bear the consequences of their sin without harming the Church.\n\nLoving your neighbor, even your neighbor who is your enemy, doesn’t mean disconnecting from them— cancellation is the easy way out. Much harder is what we’re actually called to as Christians:\n\n* Have coffee with your neighbor, who is falling down an anti-semitic rabbit hole on the internet.\n\n* Invite the radical trans activist down the street over for dinner.\n\n* Offer to mow the lawn for the MAGA relative you think is a crazy person.\n\n* Don’t withhold your disagreement when you meet— but disagree accurately, with love, not malice.\n\n* Apologize for the times you’ve sinned against your neighbor or enemy in the past… even if they haven’t apologized to you. We repent to follow Christ, not for other people.\n\n* Love yourself enough to not allow them to abuse or manipulate you.\n\nThis won’t always prevent you from losing friendships— sometimes even accurate disagreements are dealbreakers— but it should mean that you aren’t the one breaking relationships; you are the one seeking loving reconciliation, just as Jesus seeks from us. This will sometimes be painful. That, too, is expected. Throughout the Bible, people grieve, bargain, and argue with God about the hardships and feelings they experience.\n\nHebrews 12:1-2 tells us to “…run with endurance the race that lies before us, keeping our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.”\n\nChristianity is not about loving people who make us feel safe and comfortable, happy and healthy. There is no exception to loving your neighbor for marginalized or oppressed people— early Christians were an extremely marginalized and oppressed people! Paul was first Saul. Global Christians are frequently persecuted for their faith, something ongoing in Nigeria right now. As Jesus was crucified, he prayed, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.” (Luke 23:34) Christianity is transformational because we are called to love our enemies— enduring, forgiving, and praying for even people who oppress us and would deny our humanity.",
