I’ve been thinking about our culture’s twin rejection of virtue and shame for a while now, and over time, I changed my mind about the value of shame, but I hadn’t yet committed any of my thoughts to writing.\n\n**Shame is a net good.**\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!glRw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a3f893a-86e6-40cd-b6ad-a4e96f19ef79_1286x720.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!glRw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a3f893a-86e6-40cd-b6ad-a4e96f19ef79_1286x720.png)\n\nTo be clear, I do not think shame is always good. I use “net” advisedly, to mean that after weighing the profit and loss, _on the net_, the profits (pros) outweigh the losses (cons). However, it’s become clear to me that shame (the verb) is a necessary influence in a society that eschews virtue. I wish it weren’t this way! Unfortunately, I’ve concluded that shame is only avoidable in a society that practices self-restraint, incentivizing people to choose for themselves to avoid generally destructive ends, and where grace (forgiveness) is extended because a person has acknowledged their transgression and been forgiven.\n\nShame is at its best when it causes someone to pause and reconsider an action or belief without inhibiting them from continuing that action or belief. In a free and pluralistic society, disagreement about what constitutes immoral or destructive behavior is and will continue to be common. As a strong supporter of our First Freedoms (Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and freedom of the press), I do not want the government to compel particular beliefs or actions, so long as those actions do not infringe on others’ liberty. To maintain a highly free society, I believe we must have either a commitment to virtue (which encourages us to avoid destructive behavior and beliefs that lead to shame) and grace (a path out of shame) or a commitment to the exercise and consideration of shame. Shame enables us to create subcultures that people can freely enter and leave, where different kinds of behaviors are encouraged or discouraged by a community, but where their shame cannot cause physical harm to you or prevent you from choosing another way. **In short, shame is beneficial when it acts as a warning sign, not a punishment.**\n\nWhen people lack a commitment to virtue and hold the belief that shame is bad, even destructive acts are celebrated. For example:\n\n* Infidelity (JFK, Donald Trump, Andrew Tate, Jeff Bezos, Ken Paxton)\n* Relationships with significant age gaps (think Leonardo DiCaprio, Jake Gyllenhaal, and John Mayer)\n* Sex Work (Prostitution)\n* Porn use\n\nWithout a commitment to virtue and without social shame, unfaithfulness to your girlfriend or wife is just another preference. It’s not against the law to cheat on your partner or spouse, nor should it be. We don’t want to throw people in jail for breaking a promise. However, many things are personally or socially destructive that are not illegal. Divorce is bad for kids if you have them (except in high-conflict/abuse situations), friendships, property, earning potential, and more. We want people (for their own good and for societal good) to practice self-control and fulfill their social obligation of faithfulness to their partner, even when it requires selflessness instead of selfishness.\n\nIt’s social shame that gives us reason to cheer on Taylor Swift when she soulfully cries, “Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first!” or “You said, ‘If we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine,’ that made me want to die.” Leonardo DiCaprio dates women who are legal adults, but nearly everyone agrees that he is nonetheless doing something bad by only dating women under 25, and the internet regularly mocks him for it. What is our collective horrified reaction? It’s shame, of course. We wish he would practice the virtue of self-control and stop manipulating young women. However, they are adult women, so we don’t want to criminalize these relationships, just socially deter them.\n\nStatistics clearly show that sex work (prostitution) presents extremely high risks for women and men. Doing “sex work,” whether it’s “high-end” escorting, cam-girl work, or streetwalking, comes with extraordinarily escalated risks of coercion, drug addiction, sexual assault, rape, and other violent crime, never mind the personal health risks. No one wants their children to make a career out of OnlyFans. Yet, without the virtue of self-control or the social power of shame, many women are told and believe sex work is “empowering.” OnlyFans is seen as a legitimate career path. Being the world’s oldest profession, it’s unlikely we will ever be able to completely ban this, but with shame, we can discourage people from entering it instead of normalizing it as just another potential career path.\n\nFor decades, we’ve been throwing off the shackles of shame that previous generations felt for myriad alleged wrongs: premarital sex, illicit drug use, mental health crises, surviving abuse, out-of-wedlock pregnancies, porn use, divorce, and more. To be clear, some shame-lifting has been a great thing! It’s excellent that having a therapist is no longer seen as a shameful indicator of brokenness and is instead recognized as a tool that can help people improve their lives and relationships. It’s lifesaving that people in abusive relationships and marriages can now usually expect societal help escaping and healing from those relationships instead of condemnation for their flight. It is good that people acknowledging a porn addiction can now get help to overcome it instead of just being shunned. These are good outcomes of decreasing societal shame.\n\nSocietal shame also has negative tradeoffs:\n\n1. Shame is a blunt instrument, and the public isn’t known for its discernment.\n2. Shame is easily perverted away from promoting virtue to enforcing social conformity.\n3. Shame, like pride, can easily be taken too far, into the realm of cancel culture.\n\nNonetheless, it is still the best tool we have to discourage largely self-harming behavior. It is good to feel shame when you intentionally choose bad things, and grace is a necessary complement to enable escape from shame. We must also be careful not to warp shame into cancel culture: Forcing people to adopt your virtue is not virtuous. Threatening people’s livelihoods or housing is not a warning sign; it’s delegating force to a third party. Shaming someone comes with its own consequences; the shamed person may forever leave a community that has shamed them. Warning signs should spur people to slow down and to think twice, but not stop them from continuing down their chosen road anyway. **Shame is both imperfect and necessary in a world that has picked virtue signaling over real virtue.**",
