  "body": "The recent announcement, amidst acrimony in GOP ranks over the now-enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill,” that US Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), 64, would not seek reelection to a third six-year term next year, got me thinking about my first years as a young Capitol Hill aide. My, how Congress has changed over the years.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lpLq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F741f240d-91b0-41bb-8ee1-628fdcad00dd_1347x705.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lpLq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F741f240d-91b0-41bb-8ee1-628fdcad00dd_1347x705.png)\n\nIt’s become a tougher place to work and accomplish things. Relationships that were once common in Congress are rare today, as Members spend more time on airplanes, in their districts, and on political fundraising than working with colleagues. Sixty years ago, Members of Congress moved with their families to Washington, DC. Today, we have a Tuesday-Thursday club where they spend more time in their districts than in Washington. And there’s little, if any, incentive for members to build relationships with each other outside their party conferences, if then.\n\nTillis, whom I’ve met and worked with, surprised me somewhat by his announcement, but not that much. Sen. Tillis has always been a “workhorse” legislator, a former North Carolina State House Speaker who reveled in old-fashioned, give-and-take legislating. He’s never been one to pay fealty to any political figure or partisan agenda. He was facing a potentially challenging reelection (both his wins were by relatively narrow margins). But I thought he was well-positioned enough as a reliable, if independent, conservative with a penchant for promoting and protecting his state’s interests. He’s nowhere near as “anti-Trump” as portrayed, but I’ll admit he chose some odd battles, such as opposing Trump’s nomination to serve as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin.\n\nI arrived on Capitol Hill in my 1975 white Datsun B-210 right after New Year’s Day to my $400-per-month efficiency apartment at what used to be called The Coronet, now known as the Capitol Hill Hotel, located at Third and C Streets, Southeast. I was used to paying $85 per month for a furnished apartment back in Oklahoma (including utilities). I would soon discover that the big jump in salary from being a small-town newspaper editor making high four figures to a Capitol Hill press aide (so it seemed) would be eaten up rather quickly by the _much higher_ cost of living in the Nation’s Capital.\n\n[![Capitol Hill Hotel (Washington DC, DC): What to Know BEFORE You Bring ...](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!L6Jy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30e7517d-e2df-4176-981e-6f3d4443e6cb_474x387.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!L6Jy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30e7517d-e2df-4176-981e-6f3d4443e6cb_474x387.jpeg)\n\nThat hotel now runs for almost $400 _per night_.\n\nThe late John Paul Hammerschmidt (R-AR) hired me via a phone call to the CR Anthony clothing store in downtown Henryetta (OK) over the Christmas holidays in 1978, when I was contemplating my unemployment. I’d given up my editor’s job to be a campaign press secretary for Republican Gary Richardson’s 1978 unsuccessful congressional campaign in northeast Oklahoma. Out of a job, I was relegated to working the floor and wrapping Christmas presents in the town’s top mercantile store. I needed the money. That was _humbling_.\n\nRichardson, who would later serve as a US Attorney for Eastern Oklahoma during the Reagan Administration and make an unsuccessful run for Governor, had narrowly lost to the late Mike Synar. Hammerschmidt, along with southeast Missouri’s Gene Taylor (R-MO), had campaigned with us for a day. Hammerschmidt was looking to run for US Senate in 1980 and thought I’d make a pretty good press secretary for his congressional office - his first such hire during his seven terms in the House.\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfJhFQ0Boo0)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfJhFQ0Boo0) *[Tribute to Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfJhFQ0Boo0)*\n\n_Side note_: Hammerschmidt opted to forgo a Senate race to help his close personal friend, former Rep. George H. W. Bush (they were elected together in 1966), with his 1980 presidential campaign, specifically in the Arkansas primary. The reason for my hiring ended, and Hammerschmidt personally encouraged me to find work elsewhere, but not before having me help the Bush campaign.\n\nMore notably, I arrived in DC just as another volcano was rumbling into town—a college professor-turned-freshman Member of Congress. He finally won after two unsuccessful attempts. He would almost single-handedly disrupt and change the culture of Capitol Hill, especially the House Republican Conference. His name was Newt Gingrich (R-GA).\n\nHammerschmidt proved a valuable mentor, educating this formerly young 22-year-old aide on the ways and customs of Capitol Hill. He was considered an “old bull,” even then, with strong bipartisan relationships, especially with the chair of the Transportation Committee, then led by Robert Roe (D-NJ). When you were used to being in the minority, especially in the House, you learned to work with Democratic chairs if you wanted to influence the outcome of legislation and, most importantly, deliver things for your district. I remember many of the “rules” I was taught:\n\n* _When accepting a speaking invitation that requires travel to another colleague’s district, always call them and give them advance notice._\n\n* _Never, ever say a bad thing about a colleague, and especially never, ever file or sign on to an ethics complaint against a colleague._\n\n* _Keep politics at the water’s edge. Even when campaigning for GOP candidates, refrain from campaigning against Democratic incumbents and avoid criticizing them. You can be critical of the other political party and its policies, but rarely its candidates on a personal basis._\n\n* _Go along to get along._\n\nOkay, I added that last one, but old-timers who subscribe will understand what I mean. It belied a courtesy that is long gone in these days of the Outrage Machine\\*\\*™\\*\\*. Today, we have GOP incumbents traveling to their GOP colleagues’ districts to campaign for primary challengers, as then-Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) traveled to Wyoming in 2022 to campaign against former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY). Any review of the blizzard of fundraising texts, emails, and mailings often includes excoriating personal comments about colleagues.\n\n[![Republicans do battle: Trump ally whips up Wyoming crowd against Liz Cheney  | Republicans | The Guardian](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oN-q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05a97c5c-8163-4b19-8066-a81548e13fd9_465x279.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oN-q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05a97c5c-8163-4b19-8066-a81548e13fd9_465x279.jpeg)\n\nSeveral years later, long after I’d left Hammerschmidt’s office, the Arkansas legend would second the nomination in 1989 of Gingrich to replace Dick Cheney as the House Republican Whip (Cheney departed to serve as Secretary of Defense in the Bush 41 Administration). House GOP Leader Bob Michel (R-IL) had supported his home-state colleague Ed Madigan for the post. Gingrich won on an 87-85 vote. Michel no doubt saw the handwriting on the wall.\n\nGingrich, a PhD military historian, wasted no time on his quest to change what he saw as a permanent minority mindset to borrowing from Carl von Clausewitz’s theory of war, as explained here from Wikipedia:\n\n> “Clausewitz was among those intrigued by the manner in which the leaders of the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), especially [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon), changed the conduct of war through their ability to motivate the populace and gain access to the full resources of the state, thus unleashing war on a greater scale than had previously been seen in Europe.\n\nGingrich mentored his younger, newer colleagues - especially the younger “Reagan Robots” elected as part of the Reagan landslide in 1980, which increased the House GOP’s ranks by 34 members. He educated his colleagues on the need to create a vision, strategy, tactics, and an operational framework necessary to win a majority, which had previously been unthinkable since the House had not been under GOP control since 1954, for almost 40 years.\n\nThe old way of operating was over, at least for Republicans. Gingrich first launched the censuring of US Rep. Charles Diggs (D-MI), an African-American legislator, for taking kickbacks for which he’d been convicted just before the 1978 elections. Gingrich sought his expulsion. It worked, as Diggs resigned in 1980.\n\n[![These Infamous Congressmen Turned Out to Be Crooks - 24/7 Wall St.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vQye!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcb5a4c5-b38e-4c26-b12e-3b6c39c6355c_2560x1683.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vQye!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcb5a4c5-b38e-4c26-b12e-3b6c39c6355c_2560x1683.jpeg)\n\n*Congressman Charles Diggs (D-MI)*\n\nHis next target: House Speaker Jim Wright. That worked, too, as Wright resigned under pressure due to ethics violations, many of which involved a book he wrote, “_Reflections of a Public Man_,” that he sold in bulk mostly to lobbyists to help line his pockets. He resigned in 1989, another scalp in Newt’s office.\n\nIn a twist of fate, House Republican Leader Bob Michel, feeling the hot breath of Gingrich on his heels, chose not to seek reelection in 1994, a decision I suspect he would live to regret. Michel’s greatest ambition was to serve as Speaker of the House. By not seeking reelection, he relinquished an opportunity for the gavel that was instead presented to Gingrich as the GOP won 54 seats in 1994 and gained control of the House of Representatives. Had Michel sought and won reelection, who knows whether he or Gingrich would have been elected Speaker? We’ll never know.\n\n_Side note_: Bob Michel would have made a wonderful, if temporary and transitional, Speaker of the House. Republicans were out for blood then, not unlike today, and Michel wasn’t that kind of guy. He was a model of principled civility.\n\n[![Once upon a time, America's leaders worked together | Peoria Magazine](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F-RH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8df3495-038d-4b11-945d-4a89c0a48e93_938x1190.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F-RH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8df3495-038d-4b11-945d-4a89c0a48e93_938x1190.jpeg)\n\n*The late Congressman and former House Republican Leader Bob Michel (R-IL) in front of a statue of the late US Sen. Everett Dirksen (R-IL).*\n\nA few years later, Gingrich’s tactics would catch up with him as even his ranks rebeled against him following disappointing election results in the 1986 elections, when the GOP historically lost seats in the House (5) and the Senate (8) in a year when they were supposed to gain them (Republicans did gain eight gubernatorial seats, so there’s that). He would resign his Speakership and House seat when Congress convened in January 1999. Gingrich himself was forced to apologize and take punishment for ethical violations, including those involving his authorship of a book.\n\nI’ve often compared Gingrich to Moses. He was born to lead the GOP to the promised land, but not to enter into it or run it. But his transformation of the House GOP Conference and politics in general was essentially complete. And the Congress has never turned back.\n\nThe current political polarization isn’t all Newt’s fault, although he contributed to it. Others did as well, on both sides of the aisle. Tony Coelho was a combative Democratic House member from California and a leader who intimidated the business community into supporting his party or risk seeing their agenda torpedoed in Congress. It was straight-up bribery. The same with Rahm Emanuel, who later became Mayor of Chicago and Ambassador to Japan under the Biden Regency. Houston Rep. Tom DeLay would play a similar role for Republicans during their time in the majority. There are plenty of antagonists in this never-ending drama.\n\nBut are the legislative giants of yesteryear truly dinosaurs, never to be resurrected? Are the Everett Dirksens of the Senate, the Republican Senate leader who delivered the votes needed to help break a Southern Democratic filibuster and support a Democratic President, Lyndon Johnson, enact the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a thing of the past?\n\nNot really, but they’re in short supply and a dying breed, their efforts not just unrewarded, but often punished. And efforts at bipartisanship have fallen woefully short, especially by our presidents. The departures of legislators like Thom Tillis from the Senate don’t help. Neither do the ascension and remarkable fundraising tallies of legislative terrorists and clickbait artists, such as Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Tom Massie (R-KY), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who seem more interested in lighting fire to the grease that’s supposed to make the legislative gears work.\n\nSadly and tragically, their antics are rewarded. And what gets rewarded gets repeated.\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMmrNcdmdVY)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMmrNcdmdVY) *[George H.W. Bush inaugural address: Jan. 20, 1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMmrNcdmdVY)*\n\nIt was George H. W. Bush who, during his 1989 inaugural address, offered a hand of bipartisan cooperation to then-House Speaker Jim Wright, who promptly bit it. Barack Obama made a big deal of inviting bipartisan leaders to the White House, including his vanquished 2008 opponent, the late US Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), only to be told, “We won,” and elections have consequences. Obama shoved health care reform down the throats of Congress on a strictly partisan vote, only to see many of its mandates repealed and the ravages of Medicaid expansion now exploding the public debt.\n\nRonald Reagan enjoyed bipartisan support after his landslide win in 1980, leading to the bipartisan enactment of significant tax and spending reforms. However, at least one of the Democrats he worked with, then-US Rep. and future GOP Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), was run out of their party. Reagan did enact the last bipartisan immigration reform bill, the Simpson-Mazzoli Act of 1986, which proved to be a disaster, replete with amnesty, and excessive executive control and responsibility.\n\nTo be sure, we have plenty of terrific legislators in Congress, and they’re typically the ones you never hear of, starting with the chairs and ranking members of committees, such as Ways and Means, and Transportation and Infrastructure in the House. We can add the floor leaders, whose job is to produce legislation. That includes my friend John Thune (R-SD), the Senate Majority Leader, and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA). I’ll quickly add my friend Tom Cole (R-OK), chair of the House Appropriations Committee. There are plenty of others who have to produce annual or periodic authorization and appropriation bills, and know how to work across the aisle to get stuff done.\n\nI’d love to add names of Democrats who I believe are genuinely interested in bipartisan cooperation, but I can’t think of any. US Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) is as close as it comes. U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), from Silicon Valley, might be another. Most others seem too terrified of their radical and violence-prone progressive base.\n\nMeanwhile, well-meaning constituents bang on their doors and treat them like ATM machines, constantly begging for dollars. It helps explain why we have a $36 trillion deficit. Members don’t like to say no.\n\n[![Tom Cole: The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is a win for America - Indianz.Com](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uX22!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa068bcf7-cb44-466e-b3a0-dfe00c8c6fad_2048x1362.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uX22!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa068bcf7-cb44-466e-b3a0-dfe00c8c6fad_2048x1362.jpeg)\n\n*US Rep. and House Appropriations Committee Chair, Tom Cole (R-OK)*\n\nThere’s an art and science to the legislative process. Ultimately, it’s about having the votes to get things done, and the courage to make tough decisions. Fortunately, we've public servants whom you’ve likely never heard of who are delivering, but it’s becoming more difficult. And it’s getting harder, given the intransigence of ideologues and show-horses who are more about making points and raking in campaign cash than making progress.\n\nNo, Members of Congress aren’t necessarily measured by how many bills they pass or enact. Sometimes, stopping bad legislation or regulation is just as valuable as enacting good legislation or regulation. Our system, with its emphasis on checks and balances, makes it more difficult to enact changes. And we pay a price when it fails, such as with much of Obamacare or the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution from the 1960s. There are plenty of examples. Thus is the American experience.\n\nThere’s no way to turn back the clock and return to the days of the great legislators of the past, such as Everett Dirksen, Lyndon Johnson, or many others. The question is, how will we overcome the polarization of today and begin to address the issues that are staring us in the face, from Social Security and Medicare reform to our burgeoning $36 billion federal debt?\n\nIt starts with a simple proposition that I’ve already mentioned: what gets rewarded gets repeated. The art and science of legislating isn’t dead, but it’s a sick puppy.\n\nStop rewarding clickbait artists and outrage specialists in Congress with your dollars, and start rewarding workhorses who are genuinely interested in real solutions to real problems, from the debt to the cost of prescription drugs. It begins with a relentless pursuit of truth over the pursuit of political power and the almighty dollar. A healthy dose of humility is always valuable.\n\nStart looking for and rewarding legislators more like Thom Tillis and Pennsylvania’s Dave McCormick and less like Jasmine Crockett or Marjorie Taylor Greene, attention-seekers who accomplish nothing while raking in millions of your dollars for reasons I’ll never understand. Until we do that, nothing will change, including the growing severity of our issues and crises, from our massive public debt to our ability to address growing threats from abroad.",
