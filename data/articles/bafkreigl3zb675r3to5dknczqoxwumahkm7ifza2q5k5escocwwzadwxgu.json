Those elements align with other major U.S. cases against foreign officials. What stands out is **how openly the charging document folds U.S. foreign-policy positioning into the narrative of a criminal case**.\n\nMost high-profile indictments — whether against Latin American generals, Russian cyber units, or Chinese military officers — follow a strict convention: describe roles, outline conduct, prove statutory elements. Even when they span decades or implicate state institutions, they avoid engaging in **political recognition, legitimacy, or regime-status arguments**. The law speaks through conduct, not diplomacy.\n\nThis one breaks that norm.\n\nFrom the opening pages, the document describes Nicolás Maduro as the **“de facto but illegitimate ruler”**, recounts disputed elections, cites the **non-recognition of his presidency by dozens of states**, and revisits the political conflict between the National Assembly and the executive. None of this is necessary to establish conspiracy, venue, or statutory jurisdiction — yet it is placed alongside the criminal narrative, giving the indictment the character of a **hybrid instrument: part prosecution, part geopolitical statement**.\n\nThis matters.\n\nA criminal indictment normally avoids making declarative claims about **who should or should not govern a sovereign state**. When the United States indicted **Manuel Noriega**, the legal narrative emphasized trafficking, corruption, and state-facilitated crime — but it did not explicitly contest the legitimacy of the Panamanian regime. Likewise, indictments against **Russian GRU officers** or **PLA cyber-units** describe state roles and national affiliations without challenging the political status of the governments involved.\n\nHere, the text does something else: it embeds **delegitimization language inside a legal narration of crime**. That doesn’t convert the indictment into a regime-change instrument — the remedies remain standard criminal ones — but it does signal that the **forum of law is being used as a channel of strategic communication**.\n\nThe result is a new kind of “speaking indictment.” Not simply one that tells a story to support charges, but one that **aligns the story with a broader diplomatic message**: that the alleged criminal enterprise is inseparable from the political structure at the top of the Venezuelan state. In effect, the indictment narrates a world in which the boundary between **criminal liability and geopolitical non-recognition** becomes porous.\n\nThat is what is not typical. And that is where the document becomes more than a legal artifact — it becomes a text sitting at the intersection of **prosecution, foreign policy, and narrative power**.\n\n**Maduro Indictment**\n\n557KB ∙ PDF file\n\n[Download](https://karat.substack.com/api/v1/file/e363372e-b792-4453-8752-3b249f8f5b2d.pdf)",
