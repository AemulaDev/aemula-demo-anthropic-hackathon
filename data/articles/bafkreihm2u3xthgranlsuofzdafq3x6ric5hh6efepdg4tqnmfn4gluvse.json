Michael Vose’s Concord office echoed against the cheap pine paneling like a dare. Outside, the late-August air was pressure-thick—humid, motionless, waiting to break. But inside the old State House, something already had.\n\nA single-page bill lay flat on his desk—no fine print, no riders, no multi-part clauses stacked like sandbags. Just House Bill 672—a legislative fuse that could rewrite a century of energy law.\n\n“It would allow any power provider operating off the grid to bypass the regulatory thicket that’s governed U.S. electricity for nearly a century.”¹\n\nVose didn’t look up. “Every minute we waste is a year we lose,” he said, his voice dry and sandpapered from years of being ignored until the fire started. “If the grid can’t keep up, we’ll build without it.”\n\nThe lights buzzed overhead—fluorescents, not LEDs—and in their hum was the ghost of a larger crisis. Data centers, crypto miners, AI model trainers—every one of them demanding a kind of power that the U.S. electrical grid, stitched together with copper and committee meetings, can no longer reliably deliver.\n\n“We’ve let regulation kill the experiment,” Vose said. “But New Hampshire’s done waiting.”\n\nHB 672’s language was simple, but its impact wasn’t. Any electricity provider that didn’t connect to the grid could be exempt from utility regulation. No hearings. No lobbying. No plea before the Public Utilities Commission.²\n\nBack in Washington, the idea was treated somewhere between heresy and science fiction. A Department of Energy analyst, requesting anonymity, sighed over the phone: “There’s a reason Edison and Westinghouse gave way to the TVA and FERC. Chaos doesn’t scale.”³\n\nHe wasn’t wrong. But neither was Vose, who had started quoting old-school capitalists instead of grid planners. “The sector wasn’t built by regulators,” he told a room of puzzled reporters. “It was built by people willing to try something dumb—and occasionally brilliant.”\n\nWhat came next wasn’t theory.\n\nA few miles west, on the outskirts of Claremont, the buzz of innovation wasn’t metaphorical—it was literal.\n\nYou could feel it in the cinderblock halls of an old machine shop turned techno-speakeasy. The air smelled faintly of solder. Coiled wires hung from ceiling beams. Racks of lithium battery cells hummed beside a miniature turbine spinning silently under test.\n\n“We’re not a utility,” said Anika Shore, a former distribution engineer turned startup CEO. “We’re a service. Like FedEx. You want electrons delivered reliably, fast, and securely—we can do that.” She tapped a panel on a prototype microgrid wall. A pulse of current surged through the system.\n\n“The difference is, I don’t need to file a 200-page docket to try a new routing topology.”\n\n“What FedEx did to the post office,” she added, “we’re about to do to the utilities.”⁴\n\nHer company—VoltFox Energy—had been stuck in regulatory molasses in Massachusetts. In New Hampshire, they built their first pilot in six weeks. A data analytics firm down the road got clean solar-wind hybrid power for its server racks. VoltFox got a real-world testbed with no public hearings, no PUC filings, and no delays.\n\nBut theory, as always, was about to collide with hardware.\n\nThe trick wasn’t generation. It was everything else: interconnection rules, transformer placement, maintenance protocols. Off-grid meant off-script. It meant breaking the handshake monopoly between regulated utilities and state commissions and replacing it with something faster, messier, and a lot more dangerous.\n\n**And the risks weren’t theoretical.** Deregulated microgrids had already sparked safety debates over battery fires, unmonitored emissions from diesel backups, and prototype reactors installed without NERC oversight.⁵ Labor groups warned of undertrained operators. Critics feared a patchwork energy future where reliability depended more on risk appetite than engineering standards. And without that trust, the grid’s last monopoly—legitimacy—could erode even faster than its customer base.\n\nStill, the numbers tilted toward speed.\n\nA Cato Institute study showed regulatory delays added one to five years to most grid-related projects.⁶ Each new substation or corridor required environmental review and a Byzantine approval process across overlapping jurisdictions. In Loudoun County, Virginia—“Data Center Alley”—utilities were quoting six-year wait times for new power hookups. In Claremont, VoltFox was off and running in 19 weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, global demand was compounding. The International Energy Agency estimated that by 2030, AI model training alone could consume more electricity annually than the entire country of Japan.⁷\n\nNot everyone was cheering.\n\nEnvironmental groups warned about emissions loopholes and the precedent of allowing unregulated nuclear micro-reactors. Labor unions raised alarms about workplace safety and grid reliability. And incumbent utilities, while outwardly cordial, were already preparing legal challenges. Regulators worried about ratepayer equity—how fixed grid maintenance costs might shift onto rural or low-income customers if high-volume commercial users defected.\n\nBut some utilities saw the writing on the transformer.\n\nAt a diner in Nashua, Ken Holbrooke, a mid-level strategist at Eversource, stirred his coffee while watching a delivery drone skim the power lines.\n\n“If we can’t beat ’em,” he said, “maybe we build faster under a different name.”\n\nHe stared out the window. “It’s like watching your monopoly get eaten by a thousand startups with soldering irons.”\n\nAsked what that might mean in practice, he shrugged. “We’ve got the capital. We’ve got the engineers. Nothing says we can’t play both sides—regulated and rogue.”\n\nBack in Concord, Vose folded HB 672 into his breast pocket and stood by the window. Outside, the clouds had cracked open. Sunlight streaked through the haze and lit the rooftops in copper and gold.\n\nNew Hampshire might not save the American grid.\n\nBut it was already breaking the silence.\n\nThe hum of fluorescent lights carried a new resonance—not failure, but possibility.\n\nAnd whether that future will scale—or short—may depend on how long the grid can hold its monopoly on trust.\n\n***\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
