  "body": "_Part 1 with my predictions for 2026 can be found_ _[here](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/part-i-predictions-and-resolutions)._\n\n**“Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every year find you a better man.”**\n\n\\- Benjamin Franklin\n\n**“He who breaks a resolution is a weakling; He who makes one is a fool.”**\n\n\\- Farquhar McGillivray Knowles\n\nI only had two New Year’s resolutions last year: to lose a lot of weight. And to publish my first book, “_[Walk Through History](https://www.amazon.com/Walk-Through-History-Americas-Story-ebook/dp/B0G5LM5HRL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=B5LIBIU4BMMD\\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kdp6B2wQVTGDNeUwXWgDdFtMr93O9u25Js5YIgJsWvUsFr_lp0fXgXvVi7je2dCmf7u29nvmoSzNoS09osU05uaDOQFREkaSp__lWaIskX9bw3sz8Hlo1rOrbVuCrpVi.gtiYEKiiW-LHEnT4Blq6lunzf1A0JNZcC0AokL_Spfs\\&dib_tag=se\\&keywords=walk+through+history+johnston\\&qid=1766856510\\&sprefix=walk+through+history%2Caps%2C122\\&sr=8-1)_.” And I did, although it has minor formatting errors and a couple of typos, and it is only in a Kindle format for now. One of my first resolutions for 2026 is to record an audio version and publish a paperback to distribute via a second edition.\n\nMy first 2026 resolution: _keep the weight off._ Going through significant weight loss episodes is no fun. It is fun, however, to put on clothes you’ve not been able to wear for a few years, and even some of those are too big now (not to mention being out of fashion).\n\nFor 2026, I’m going to write a second book, a biography that is primarily a compendium of stories from a life in politics, with family history. It’s specifically for my family, and in particular, my progeny, so don’t look for it on Amazon. I’ve already started with a two-hour taped interview with my 88-year-old mom. Collecting and learning family history has been fascinating. The stories are fun, and my mom came across a booklet from her aunt, the daughter of a Union Civil War veteran who marched with Gen. William T. Sherman, that talks about her upbringing in Missouri and her move to the Oklahoma Territory during the second Land Run in 1891.\n\nAn interesting tidbit from my late, great aunt, Violet Burris Hodecker: tomatoes were once considered [poisonous](https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/tomato-called-a-love-apple.htm) by European settlers. They were also called “love apples.” But they discovered they were delicious. Campbell’s tomato soup has been its top seller for decades.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8jx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7334dced-b3d6-43fe-bf83-cd4ca56b26e5_290x290.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8jx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7334dced-b3d6-43fe-bf83-cd4ca56b26e5_290x290.jpeg)\n\nI’ll add a fourth resolution, which I actually tried two years ago and failed: adding a podcast to this blog. I was gifted a podcasting kit for Christmas, and I’m excited to get it started. It will start as an audio version of these posts, but I’ll expand it to include an occasional interview and maybe more.\n\nAlmost 40 years ago, I was a subcontractor providing media training for government executives, especially at the Department of the Interior (National Park Service, Minerals Management Service, etc.). I taught a class for years to government information technology professionals - officials who managed major acquisition programs - on how to deal with hostile media. It was sponsored by the General Services Administration’s “Trail Boss” program, which ended during the Clinton Administration (proof that some temporary government programs actually end, even during Democratic Administrations). Even four decades ago, I taught that anyone with a computer and a modem (_remember those?_) could be a “reporter.” And that was before, and just as the internet began to explode on the scene.\n\n[![Media Interview.

Aside from being Certified Tourism Ambassadors for Loudoun County, Virginia, our environs are home to about 50 wineries, most of which we have visited, plus a few others in nearby Fauquier County, upper Montgomery County, Maryland, and a few others elsewhere. Loudoun wines have dramatically improved in quality over the past several decades, and the region has matured, with several distinctive varietals that thrive in our challenging climate.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g4xi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba03eaf8-4b00-4815-a6b7-b4e28ac6b20f_659x878.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g4xi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba03eaf8-4b00-4815-a6b7-b4e28ac6b20f_659x878.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:My wine room right after I installed it in 2023. It’s full now. It’s in the coldest section of our home.}}\n\nThe birthplace of Virginia wine is Albemarle County, Virginia, but there’s already too much written about those wineries. That’s the Charlottesville area, home to Monticello and several outstanding wines. We know several winemakers and growers, and you’ll have an opportunity to learn about them and their amazing stories. It’s a wonderful, fun, and fascinating industry with a rich and vibrant history. We might even throw in a Pennsylvania wine or two or three. It ranks right behind Virginia as one of our nation’s top wine-making (#8) and winery (#6) states, and we have a couple of favorites minutes north of the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nDid you know that every state in the nation produces wine, even Alaska and Hawaii (pineapple)? Even in Illinois, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Texas has a burgeoning wine region near Fredericksburg, about 45 minutes north and west of San Antonio in their estimable Hill Country.\n\nMy bride and I have been following and sampling Virginia wines for nearly all of our 41 years of marriage. They’ve come a long way.\n\nBack to resolutions. Those are mine, and maybe they’ll inspire one or two of your own. Here is another, followed by another post or two for all of us, inspired by Benjamin Franklin’s marvelous quote above.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4j8Q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F444ad353-1f30-476e-a4de-d357b7125b9a_1100x635.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4j8Q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F444ad353-1f30-476e-a4de-d357b7125b9a_1100x635.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Graphic courtesy of Bruce Mehlman and his Subtack, “Age of Disruption.”}}\n\n**Re-Balance Your Media Diet**\n\nIt is ancient news now that the “traditional” or “mainstream media,” think the three major broadcast networks, _Associated Press_, and other large wire services (Reuters, etc.), and major national newspapers (_New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal_) are, with minor exception, badly broken. The _Times_ and the _Post_, in particular, allowed themselves to be used and deluded by nefarious, malevolent actors within our national security and intelligence agencies to perpetuate not just the Russia collusion hoax in 2016-17, but also censored the _New York Post’s_ breaking news coverage in October 2020 of Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nThe lack of accountability rankles many Americans, including me.\n\nHow did this happen? The easy answer is that Donald Trump broke them, but it’s way deeper than that. Over time, they became prisoners of malevolent sources and college-inspired and indoctrinated world views. They replaced a relentless pursuit of truth, presented factually and fairly to allow you, the consumer, to make your own judgment, with the push of well-worn and often false narratives. Never has the public held the media in such contempt, and deservedly so, and most of the legacy media seems oblivious to it.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XN2R!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c1c58b-144b-4543-8f87-c4f2ea364741_1220x1162.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XN2R!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c1c58b-144b-4543-8f87-c4f2ea364741_1220x1162.png)\n\nThe _Times_ and the _Post_ have never returned the Pulitzer Prizes “won” for their phony coverage of a provably false story (the Russia collusion hoax). And the corrupt Pulitzer organization has never asked for them back. They breathe the rarified and delusional air of Georgetown and upper West Side (Manhattan) cocktail parties and rarely venture outside Amtrak’s Acela corridor (Washington-New York-Boston), except to sneer at “flyover” states on their way to Los Angeles and San Francisco in America’s most dysfunctional and poorly run state.\n\nThey way too heavily rely on polling, much of it worthless, and couldn’t dissect much less read a scientific study if their lives depended on it; they’re only interested in the results, no matter the lack of peer review in many cases and poor constructs. Again, they cherry-pick both for clickbait and do us a disservice in the process. Speaking of polling, most public polls are crap. But I do follow a few that have survived the test of time, including the [IBD-TIPP poll](https://tippinsights.com/); [Rasmussen Reports](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/); [Harvard Harris CAPS;](https://harvardharrispoll.com/) and [Echelon Insights](https://echeloninsights.com/).\n\nFortunately, a new generation of digital media outlets has emerged to counter the propaganda and woke narrative pushers at these major outlets, who desperately feed the Outrage Machine for clicks and relevance, and to protect, if not promote, the sources on which they rely. I encourage you to follow them. Others, such as The Free Press founder and editor, and now head of CBS News, Bari Weiss, are rediscovering and unearthing American journalism’s original mission: the relentless pursuit of truth and the presentation of facts to the public so we can make our own judgments.\n\nNews aggregators are an especially interesting and exciting new industry. First begun by the now-disgraced _Drudge Report,_ it has grown to include a few awe-inspiring, largely unbiased sites that give me both sides of an issue and cover items that more biased outlets on the left and the right tend to ignore.\n\nWho are they? Here are my latest favorites:\n\n[Straight Arrow News](https://san.com/)\n\n[Feedspot.com](https://www.feedspot.com/reader/all) (this is a powerful site that allows you to curate your sources and create your own aggregation of news and opinion)\n\n[The Flyover](https://jointheflyover.com/flyover-home/) (I’m an investor, mostly for their excellent, early-morning 15 minute podcast summary of the news)\n\n[Ground News](https://ground.news/)\n\nAs for other media, I still subscribe to many mainstream publications, including the _Washington Post_, the _New York Times_, and the _Wall Street Journal_. The WSJ, in particular, I find generally well balanced, and its editorial pages remain a gold standard. Another right-leaning news aggregator I assiduously follow is _[justthenews.com](https://justthenews.com/)_, created and led by former _Washington Post, AP,_ and _The Hill_ investigative journalist John Solomon. Isaac Saul’s _[Tangle News](https://www.readtangle.com/)_ and _[Allsides.com](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news)_ have promise, but lack the breadth of media aggregation featured in Ground News and Straight Arrow News.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UXMB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F084d4218-af16-4905-a835-18422a1b39c4_2000x1582.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UXMB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F084d4218-af16-4905-a835-18422a1b39c4_2000x1582.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:I don’t agree with some of this, but Ad Fontes Media is itself biased.}}\n\nBut as _Ground News_ documents, the most significant errors in the media might not be bias, but _sins of omission_ - their failure and outright refusal to cover specific stories. One really needs a breadth of sources to get a complete picture. Several excellent investigative reporters, from Lee Smith, Ben Weingarten, and Lee Fang to Matt Taibbi, have found a home on Substack, which is fast becoming America’s new Town Hall (not to be confused with _Townhall.com_, to which I also subscribe, which is a home for “red meat” conservative opinion. I also recommend following Michael Shellenberger, the author and former progressive environmental activist (and California Independent gubernatorial candidate), who has written authoritatively on homelessness in the Golden State.\n\nFor opinion journalism, the longstanding _National Review_ and both _[American Spectator](https://spectator.org/)_ and _Spectator USA_ (with British origins) remain personal favorites. The _[Compact](https://www.compactmag.com/)_ and the _[American Compass](https://americancompass.org/)_, particularly Oren Cass's work, are especially interesting, even as I disagree with some of his views, particularly on tariffs. Cass is something of an intellectual apologist for Trumpian “America First” economic policy and served as the policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, and I highly respect his intellect. Several friends including Christine Flowers, an immigration attorney in Philadelphia, and John Heubusch, former head of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, have wonderful Substack sites and are outstanding writers. Heubusch is the author of two fabulous and well-researched fiction books, _The Shroud Conspiracy_ and _The Second Coming_.\n\nAs for broadcast media, I particularly like investigative journalist Sharyll Atkisson, the former CBS and CNN anchor and reporter who has found a home at _[Full Measure News](https://fullmeasure.news/)_ and [a fabulous Substack site](https://substack.com/@sharylattkisson). She has perhaps earned an undeserved reputation as an “anti-vaxxer,” but she brings receipts - lots of them. I also follow several election integrity and analytical sites, and pollster Patrick Ruffini at “_[The Intersection.](https://substack.com/@patrickruffini)_” Ruffini, at [Echelon Insights](https://echeloninsights.com/), is a clear-eyed Republican and one of the very few pollsters whom I trust. On the Democratic side, I assiduously follow the unwoke and clear-eyed _[The Liberal Patriot](https://www.liberalpatriot.com/)_, and especially the writing of Ruy Teixiera and John Halpin. Their guest writers often leave a lot to be desired, but that’s okay.\n\nI hope Democrats don’t take Teixiera’s and Halpin’s advice, because if they did, _they’d win_.\n\nOn the conservative side, Seth Keshel’s _[The Captain’s Corner](https://www.captaink.us/)_ is a must-follow for serious politicos and election integrity enthusiasts. He’s falsely accused of being a 2020 “election denier,” but he brings receipts, too. On economics, [Peter St. Onge](https://substack.com/@profstonge), who is rejoining the once-great Heritage Foundation, has fascinating analyses.\n\nI must mention two other terrific journalists I follow: Molly Hemingway, editor in chief of _The Federalist_ and the co-author of the well-documented _Rigged,_ a definitive book on the 2020 election, and [Salena Zito](https://salenazito.com/), who writes for several publications, including the _New York Post_ and _the Washington Examiner_. Salena and Brad Todd wrote the definitive book of the 2016 election, _The Great Revolt,_ and her fabulous post 2024 election tome, “_[Butler](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/butler-a-book-review?utm_source=publication-search)_.” Salena’s “beat,” per the title of her Substack, is “The middle of somewhere.” She focuses on those exurban and rural communities, especially in Appalachia and the upper Midwest (especially western Pennsylvania, where she resides)\n\nAnd I haven’t even mentioned several podcasts and radio shows I try to keep up with, including my friends Hugh Hewitt and Chris Stigall at the Salem Radio Network (Chris also has a terrific conservative blog site, the _Harrumph Society_). Hugh is the best interviewer in the media. I really like Eli Lake’s new podcast, _Breaking History_, and Ben Domenech’s “_Big Ben Show_.” You’ll find both in the usual places that you find podcasts. There are others too numerous to mention here, and I apologize to friends and acquaintances for not mentioning theirs.\n\nThere are many other people I follow, and visiting my main page here on Substack will show other sites I follow and recommend. _[RealClearPolitics.com](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/)_ and its companion sites, including _RealClearInvestigations.com_ and _RealClearPolling.com_, are valuable resources that present a balanced collection of reporting, analysis, and opinion.\n\nI spend a chunk of change on subscriptions, but we should resolve to reward those writers and outlets that meet this simple standard: 1) they’re informative, clear-eyed, and factual; 2) they’re honest and open about their biases and points of view; and 3) they’re constructive and civil. They don’t feed The Outrage Machine\\*\\*™\\*\\*.\n\nHere’s the problem: we all know who the operators of The Outrage Machine\\*\\*™\\*\\* are, whether those so-called “strategists” and spinmeisters. The media runs to provocative pundits like James Carville - a “legendary” Democratic political consultant who probably hasn’t won a race since Bill Clinton’s election in 1992 - because they’re “hot” on camera. Meanwhile, more reasonable and informative voices get drowned out. You’ll have to go to C-SPAN for them.\n\nThe same applies to Members of Congress. We all know who Jasmine Crockett and Marjorie Taylor Greene are. They’re good for a 10-second sound bite and not much else. After all, as the late Roger Ailes once opined, the media is about getting their headline, or these days, their “clickbait.” Now, name “workhorses” in Congress who actually do their homework and work for good policy outcomes and aren’t prone to outrageous quips that the media migrates to like moths to a bug zapper?\n\n{{youtube:TTUQyEr-sg0}}\n\nDon’t be intimidated by all this. Yes, I spend most of my waking hours consuming much of this. And I’ve left out a few other sources, with apologies. I’ve decided not to invest time trashing the key elements of the Outrage Machine, but you know who they are. Learning to curate the filters through which we are barraged with information will help us achieve Ben Franklin’s admonition to strive to be better people.\n\nPlease share any favorite or recommended media sites in the comments. I know there are more.\n\n_Next post: two final resolutions and one principle to adopt for 2025._",
