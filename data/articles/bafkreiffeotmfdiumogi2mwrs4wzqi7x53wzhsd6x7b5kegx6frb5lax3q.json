  "body": "### Not the Actual Start of the Article\n\nMuch like Colts quarterback Phillip Rivers and direct U.S. intervention in South America, I’m back. I apologize for the time away: Beginning in June, the year brought multiple unexpected difficulties on the family’s physical health front, and I’ve spent the last few months getting used to the rhythm of gainful re-employment, which, for all its many upsides, consumes rather a lot of the time that, for the first eight months of this year, went to writing and staring pensively into the trees situated just south of our local library.\n\nBut the calluses are back, and so too soon will be the articles. Absent acquiring one of those lovely Hermione Granger time-turners or tricking my body into thinking three hours of sleep is actually seven, I won’t publish as frequently as I did during the good old day or so earlier this year, but buckle up for something that, viewed from the International Space Station or some other, comparably distant vantage point, could look like consistency.\n\nIf the thought of funding what is again the side job of a corporate lawyer turns your stomach (fair), I will take zero offense to you canceling your paid subscription and taking the free route. I want you to pay, yes—I am open regarding my membership in the pro-receiving-money camp—but I do not need your financial support, and I want you to pay if, and only if, (i) you have the means and (ii) you think the writing and intent behind it worth paying for at the exorbitant rates Substack forces me to charge you. Regardless, there is little downside to the free route; if an article is behind a paywall, know either that it’s unreadably long, I’ve deluded myself into believing it’s so excellent I absolutely must be paid for it (which probably just means it’s unreadably long), or I pressed the wrong button.\n\n### Still Not the Actual Start of the Article\n\nBefore we begin, a reminder: I am 36 years old, I am a lawyer, and I don’t really know what I’m talking about. I read, and I try to think, but I am not a historian, economist, political scientist, business mogul, clairvoyant, or any other -ian, -ist, -ul, or -ant that would, justifiably or not, warrant anyone’s attention. As silly as it might sound, that, I hope, is my selling point: a keen, or keen enough, sense of my limitations, and of everyone’s limitations. I also am not trying to necessarily push one point of view: I won’t (intentionally) hide that I’m a liberal personally, but this is not intended to be a liberal newsletter.\n\nI steadfastly believe there is real, practical reason to seek to understand ourselves better, and to seek to know those on the other side better, even when we can’t stand them or suspect genuine evil intent: It’s much easier to convince someone of their wrongness if you really, really understand why _they_ believe they’re right.\n\n### The Actual Start of the Article\n\nI have read several books by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, whom all-seeing Wikipedia calls a professor, essayist, mathematical statistician, former option trader, risk analyst, and aphorist. Taleb, perhaps the rudest person on social media not currently serving as the duly elected leader of the most powerful nation in the world, may be most famous for his book _The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable_, which he has referred to as a narrative around one single idea: “our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly large deviations.”\n\nIn _The Black Swan_, Taleb claims we vastly overestimate our ability to predict the future in part because we vastly overestimate our ability to understand the past. In his words, “\\[t]he human mind suffers from three ailments as it comes into contact with history, what I call the _triplet of opacity_. They are:\n\n1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize;\n\n2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror (history seems clearer and more organized in history books than in empirical reality); and\n\n3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people, particularly when they create categories—when they ‘Platonify.’”\n\nTo put it in my own words, we tend to make judgments about the current state of affairs—such and such nation is in such and such situation—based on an incomplete knowledge of the present. Then, we seek—often confidently—to explain this current state by reference to what we _think_ we know of the past, which is likely both (i) materially less complete and, in part because it is materially less complete, (ii) materially less accurate than we think. Then, using a flawed understanding of the past to further twist what was already a flawed understanding of the present, we form a flawed picture of what comes next.\n\nThat’s a stark way of putting it, but it’s critically important to note that not understanding the past, present, or future does _not_ prevent us from acting, and it does not bar us absolutely from accurately predicting what is to come—a flawed picture may still be useful. It does, however, mean that we should view the future in terms of probabilities, not certainties, and, that we should view even these probabilities in terms of probabilities: (1) one in one thousand events do happen, and (2) what we view as a one in one thousand event may be much more or less likely than we realize.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOn Friday, January 2nd, the United States Army’s Delta Force captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife at a safe home in Caracas; the couple has since been extradited to Brooklyn. Venezuela is now led by Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, who is operating under either the control or coercion of the United States.\n\n_Sidebar: So far, I have written approximately 15,000 words in response to the operation. Am I fast? No. Am I really adding anything to the public discourse that hasn’t already been said more clearly and convincingly by other writers? I don’t know. But nonetheless! I’ve been stuck on the precipice of publication for a while, and sometimes you just need to get the ball rolling. So, tonight, please enjoy the first 1,500 or so of those words, the remainder of which I hope to publish before they are rendered obsolete by the annexation or invasion of Greenland or something so terrible to contemplate as the Dodgers signing Kyle Tucker. Sorry–carry on._\n\nHow you feel about the U.S. action to take Maduro likely depends in part on a moral judgment—_i.e._, your views on the morality of violent interference with the sovereign affairs of a foreign country and under what circumstances such interference might be justified—and what we might call a practical judgment of the action’s likely impacts—_i.e._, your views on how will this affect our position vis-à-vis China and Russia or our allies, and your assessment of the likelihood this (i) metastasizes into a larger engagement itself or (ii) encourages the President to take subsequent actions that could then metastasize into larger engagements.\n\nSetting those issues—those very important issues—aside, I want to make the first of several observations in keeping with my introduction: on the risk and unpredictability inherent in the operation itself.\n\nFrom _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-capture-maduro-venezuela.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)_:\n\n> “In August, a clandestine team of C.I.A. officers slipped into Venezuela with a plan to collect information on Nicolás Maduro, the country’s president, whom the Trump administration had labeled a narco-terrorist.\n>\n> The C.I.A. team moved about Caracas, remaining undetected for months while it was in the country. The intelligence gathered about the Venezuelan leader’s daily movements — combined with a human source close to Mr. Maduro and a fleet of stealth drones flying secretly above — enabled the agency to map out minute details about his routines.\n>\n> It was a highly dangerous mission. With the U.S. embassy closed, the C.I.A. officers could not operate under the cloak of diplomatic cover. But it was highly successful. Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a news conference that because of the intelligence gathered by the team, the United States knew where Mr. Maduro moved, what he ate and even what pets he kept.\n>\n> That information was critical to the ensuing military operation — a pre-dawn raid Saturday by elite Army Delta Force commandos, the riskiest U.S. military operation of its kind since members of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 killed Osama bin Laden in a safe house in Pakistan in 2011.\n>\n> The result was a tactically precise and swiftly executed operation that extracted Mr. Maduro from his country with no loss of American life, a result heralded by President Trump amid larger questions about the legality and rationale for the U.S. actions in Venezuela.”\n\nI recognize that as a rain-spattered-card-carrying Democrat I should be philosophically horrified by every action of the Trump administration, and especially by anything that reeks of imperialism and bullying, but—forgive me, fellow libs—I am also a deeply Anglophilic American who received most of his historical grounding from people who were pretty stoked about the British Empire and the United States’ performance during and in the wake of World War II—not to mention that I was at a deeply formative age when the Twin Towers were attacked and our soldiers went off to Afghanistan and Iraq to free the region from tyranny (I’m fuzzy on how that all turned out—perhaps something that will come up in a subsequent article). Point is, when our soldiers are involved, and when they act with commendable skill and (as far as I’m aware) honor, I first feel a rush of patriotic pride, that warm swelling in the heart of the boy who will always wonder if he committed a moral failing by not signing up to serve his country. Any broader, more thoughtful reaction—not an issue for this article—comes second.\n\nOperation Absolute Resolve took considerable skill and long, thoughtful preparation, and reading about it made me proud.\n\nBut for all that skill and preparation, and courage in the face of undeniable risk, it also took luck. Think, for a moment, about how different the conversation would have been if [helicopters](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicolas-maduro-venezuelan-operation-chinook-pilot-wounded/) had gone down, if soldiers had died or been captured; if the story around the world wasn’t that the United States _successfully_ pulled off a brazen, illegal-but-it-worked-and-Russia-and-China-have-no-leg-to-stand-on extraction of a foreign nation’s head of state, but that the United States—led by the morally rudderless, volatile, norms-trampling, _bumbling_, _incompetent_ Donald Trump—broke a dozen international laws in service of an operational failure which left American soldiers in the hands of a foreign dictator.\n\nIt is _so_ human to judge a decision or action almost solely by its outcome—we tend to do the same with our own decisions—but it doesn’t really make much sense: that a decision works out doesn’t necessarily mean it was good, and that it backfires horribly doesn’t necessarily mean it was bad. That’s especially true when the action taken pursuant to the decision faces thinking, willful opposition.\n\nContrast golf and baseball. Golfers compete, yes, but primarily with (and within) themselves: the ball sits still, everyone is quiet, and there’s no defense. If you power-hook the ball into a forest or slice a drive 60 yards west of the fairway into a parked car’s windshield—both of which I’ve done and expect to do again in the future—there’s no one to blame but the architects of your childhood trauma and, arguably, God. It’s _maddening_. One of my favorite memories is of watching my perpetually good-natured, almost pacifistic brother take a nine-iron to a stand of reeds with indiscriminate mal-intent not two holes after he chided me for reacting angrily to shanking a ball into a ditch (I actually don’t remember why I was so mad, but a ditch-shank is as good a guess as any).\n\nAs a golfer, your fate is in your own cursed hands: Outside the occasional bad luck of hitting a sprinkler head or justifiably misjudging how fast or slow a ball will roll on a particular green, if your ball ends up in a sand trap, it’s because you hit it there.\n\nNot so with baseball. In baseball, as in other sports like football (both kinds) and basketball, you have opponents who are actively working against you at every turn: On your best days, you may still fail because of their successes; on your worst, you may succeed because of their failures.\n\nYet that’s an awfully difficult reality to internalize, both for players and even the most informed observers. Watch a televised baseball game and you’ll soon find the announcers calling pitches good when they’re hit poorly and bad when they’re hit hard, almost as if the batters are irrelevant. Batters are not irrelevant, and regularly overcome the odds to hammer well-thrown pitches or completely whiff on thigh-high meatballs. When there are humans on _both_ sides of an equation, human things happen going both ways.\n\nAdultnapping the president of Venezuela is more like baseball. The Delta Force operators’ skill and months of mission-specific training—and the dead-on intelligence provided at grave personal risk by the CIA and their informants—minimized the risk; it did not eliminate it. One good—or lucky—shot could have given us an entirely different story.\n\n_That’s all for tonight—the next article will also hopefully be on a related topic, but events tend to happen faster than I can write about them._\n\n***\n\n*This article reproduces content from Never Close the Inquiry, written by Nick Hagen, and is available at* *<https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/>.
