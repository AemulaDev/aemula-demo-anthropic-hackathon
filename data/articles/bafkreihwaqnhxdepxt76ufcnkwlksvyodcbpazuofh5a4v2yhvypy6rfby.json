  "title": "Too Much Democracy, Not Enough Republic",

  "body": "At the conclusion of the First Continental Congress, a woman outside famously asked Benjamin Franklin, “What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?” and he replied, “A republic… if you can keep it.” 238 years later, I fear that we’re failing to keep it.\n\nThe founders knew that democracies are unstable and often end in tyranny of the mob, and an ideal Platonian republic, while more stable, isn’t free. The nascent US Congress watched the build-up to the French Revolution warily, as a group of anti-reactionaries who nonetheless fought and won a revolution, and who were watching the first iteration of American government, the Articles of Confederation, fail. In their fear of centralizing power in an executive, they realized they had given too much power to states and not enough to the branches of the federal government.\n\nI believe democracy advocates make similar mistakes in responding to American distrust of and cynicism about government.\n\nDemocracy advocates often emphasize a rapidly responsive government that follows popular consensus among Americans, which inspires and promotes increased distrust of republican institutions such as the Supreme Court, the Electoral College, and the US Senate. They grant too much power directly to the public as opposed to their representatives and fault features of the American republic instead of Americans’ ignorance of it. Ideological extremism (strongly held views that are significantly out of alignment with most Americans) is conflated with attitudinal extremism (dehumanizing, angry, and manipulative engagement). While diverse coexistence is promoted, the importance of pluralistic structures like states’ rights that enable that peaceful coexistence are downplayed or worse, causing people to treat “red states” and “blue states” as bugs instead of recognizing them as a vital feature of the American republic.\n\nAccording to Nathan Kalmoe, Executive Administrative Director for the University of Wisconsin’s Center for Communication and Civic Renewal (CCCR), even the Constitution itself shouldn’t exist, because it is a non-democratic document. He was featured as a keynote speaker alongside another professor who doesn’t believe in America’s founding republican institutions, at a seminar titled “Sustaining Democracy” at Western Washington University. This mindset doesn’t preserve American pluralism or our Constitutional government. It doesn’t create civically educated youth who understand the checks and balances of government. It creates revolutionaries who believe the republic is deeply unfair and systemically racist, and who have never heard of the “tyranny of the majority.”\n\nWhat does it mean to keep the republic vs. democractizing goverment?\n\nIn a democracy, the law is determined by majority vote. The law is not oriented toward the outcome of greatest human flourishing; instead, it is only a popularity contest. This leads to less human flourishing for everyone. If capitalism is a rising tide that lifts all boats, then democracy is the tsunami that rips everything from its foundations. Democracy empowers the masses, for better and for worse. A constitutional republic, on the other hand, creates a series of checks and balances— ambition checking ambition, power distributed and decentralized as much as possible while still preserving national security and the ability of the people to act together through elected representatives.\n\nIn a democracy, everyone is disincentivized from accepting short-term losses for long-term gains. The moment a majority of Americans are dissatisfied, parties and people are changed out, and attempt at long-term gain is overturned. A Constitutional republic of the sort designed by America’s Founders sought to prevent that outcome, but is at risk of being lost because Americans have incredibly short attention spans and have come to believe that we are a direct democracy with a strong executive rather than a republic with a weak executive.\n\nIn a country that understood and embraced our republic, anger would be directed at Congress, and people would organize to oust their Congressional representatives who fail to do their jobs. Instead, we get widespread “No Kings” protests, not demanding that Congress pass bipartisan bills rewriting immigration law, or clearly draw back their power to tariff — both filed bills that have failed to pass in the last few years— just expressing anger at the President and Executive Branch agencies for their actions. But the complaints, from progressives and zero-sum Republicans alike, are that the President isn’t responding to their passions, not that Congress should limit his power.\n\nIn Congress, likewise, the things they do manage to pass are social media demands like releasing the Epstein files, even though there are real legal concerns about the degree to which innocent people might be defamed because of innocent associations with Epstein. Congress could impeach President Trump to shut down TikTok (a bill they’ve already passed), ending a major influence effort by arguably our greatest geopolitical foe; instead, they allow Trump to engage in corrupt dealmaking as TikTok usage continues unabated, shortening attention spans and making Americans less literate. Congress could change any number of immigration policies, improving its constituents’ satisfaction with government and helping Americans flourish, but as long as Americans believe the primary goal of government is rapid responsiveness to national democratic demands instead of acting to conserve “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” we will continue to experience dramatic governmental changes with every president and Americans will continue undermining the Constitution’s republican instutions, believing them to be the problem instead of the solution.",
