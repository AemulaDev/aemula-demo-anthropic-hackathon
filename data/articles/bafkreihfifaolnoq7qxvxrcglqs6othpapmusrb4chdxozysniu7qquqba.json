  "body": "My [most recent post](https://open.substack.com/pub/travismonteleone/p/why-why-liberalism-failed-fails-part?r=1l2z5n&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) outlined why Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed* is so relevant to today's political discourse. For moderates on both sides of the aisle looking to defend liberal democracy, how one responds to Deneen's book is critically important. In this series, I'll be outlining my three main criticisms of the book from a center-right perspective.\n\nMy first criticism, detailed in Part I, centered on Deneen's oversimplified definition of liberalism. His strawman definition allows for the wholesale dismissal of the entire liberal project. In reality, liberalism's varied and competing philosophical lineages make it both historically contingent and capable of great flexibility and resilience, a fact which Deneen refuses to address.\n\nRather than the whole of liberalism inevitably leading to negative outcomes as Deneen claims, liberalism, properly understood, has evolved in response to various challenges over time to reach its present state, and there is no reason to believe that liberalism can't reinvent itself once again to solve any number of present issues. Again, liberalism's key benefit is its flexibility and dynamism. By painting liberalism into a monolithic box, Deneen incorrectly defines liberalism's key benefits away.\n\nThis first critique was definitional and really just an appetizer compared to my second and third critiques, which I think hold much more weight.\n\n## The Inevitability Thesis, Toddlers, and Teenagers\n\nEven if we grant Deneen's definition of liberalism as a monolithic block that excludes any communitarian elements, Deneen characterizes the negative effects of liberalism as an *inevitable* Hegelian wave, rather than a contingent reality.\n\nMy second critique is that this \"inevitability thesis\" is based on a view of human nature that is overly pessimistic and wildly out of step with the Judeo-Christian worldview that has dominated the West for the past 2,500 years.\n\nDeneen argues that liberalism has led to an atomization of society in which individuals are the ultimate end. This elevation of the individual, he argues, has led to both the destruction of local communities and an infantile attraction to individualistic hedonism in place of meaningful long-term fulfillment. Fair enough. The [breakdown of local communities](http://bowlingalone.com/) has been well documented, and the cult of the individual has undoubtedly contributed to the [crisis of meaning](https://www.cslewisinstitute.org/resources/does-the-modern-world-face-a-crisis-of-meaning/).\n\nBut *crucially* (and mistakenly) Deneen argues that these negative consequences are *inevitable* given liberalism's initial elevation of the individual. He argues that if individuals are granted wide-ranging freedoms, then loss of community, rampant opulence, and social decay will follow, *necessarily*. Therefore, liberalism's elevation of the individual doomed it from the start.\n\nThe inevitably thesis is not true, however, so long as you hold a relatively high view of human nature.\n\nOne's view of human nature's ability to handle freedom and responsibility, what I'll call \"humanology\" for simplicity, is a fundamental driver of whether one agrees or disagrees with Deneen's entire project.\n\nIf humans are capable of handling freedom and responsibility, then Deneen's inevitably thesis fails. If human nature is such that freedom can't be handled responsibly and inevitably leads to hedonism, then Deneen is right.\n\nAs a thought experiment, the question boils down to whether humans are toddlers or teenagers. The freedoms of liberalism can be thought of as our first car. If humans are teenagers, there is a reasonable chance we will act responsibly and drive safely. There's also a real chance that we will misuse our freedom and get a ticket or crash. The likelihood of each outcome depends on the values of each individual, how well our community has prepared us for driving, and our own free choices. Success and failure are both realistic outcomes.\n\nIf we are toddlers, however, it does not matter how well-intentioned we or our community are, the result will be a disaster. Deneen believes that we are toddlers. Since we are toddlers, we are incapable of choosing to pursue virtue or build meaningful communities within a liberal framework. This view, however, is theologically and philosophically suspect and lacks strong historical intellectual backing. In short, Deneen's argument contradicts the Western tradition.\n\n## The High Humanology of the British Enlightenment\n\nThe English and Scottish Enlightenments, which Deneen goes to great lengths to dismiss, embody the teenager approach to humanology. The British approach represents a \"high humanology\", roughly corresponding to a 7 out of 10 on a hypothetical humanology scale. This moderately optimistic approach emphasizes the ability of humans to use reason and properly construed institutions to promote cooperation and the cultivation of virtue.\n\nJohn Locke, for example, believed that while state power is needed to protect against the worst excesses of human depravity, ultimately the people should keep the state accountable by giving their consent to be governed. This social contract is implicitly entered into freely, and this responsibility to keep the state accountable necessarily requires a relatively high view of human nature. According to Locke, the people ultimately have power over the state. For this arrangement to work, the people must be responsible enough to handle this power.\n\nAdam Smith likewise defended a high humanology. While Smith recognized that a state-of-nature approach to human interaction would likely lead to chaos, an approach that allowed for self-interested interaction within the confines of well-designed institutions, including markets and political institutions, would lead to mutual gain, natural cooperation, and ultimately the cultivation of virtue.\n\nJames Madison wrote the US Constitution amidst the backdrop of the high humanology supported by English and Scottish intellectuals. According to Madison, while humans do have impulses that can lead to antisocial behavior, the design of shackled institutions with societal oversight is a means to both maximize freedom and promote cooperative ends.\n\nThe government that resulted from Madison's pen was a uniquely theorized institution, and its intent was exactly this - to use checks and balances, federated power, and public accountability to shackle state power and maximize individual freedom.\n\nIn other words, the US government, the great liberal experiment, the culmination of the political and social impact of Locke, Smith, Madison and many others, is based on the belief that individual liberty coupled with shackled institutions will result in virtue, cooperation, and a \"more perfect Union\".\n\nBen Franklin's famous \"[if you can keep it](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/constitutionalconvention-september17.htm)\" quip can be read as a warning that if this republic is to work, we had better be right about our ability to handle freedom responsibly. This bet on the American people is the high humanology of the American founding.\n\n## The Protestant Roots of the British Enlightenment\n\nDeneen, of course, rejects this high humanology. But the British Enlightenment, unlike its French counterpart, was not formed in an intellectual vacuum. The [major differences](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-british-american-and-french-enlightenments/) between the British and French Enlightenments are surprisingly underappreciated, but to summarize, the British Enlightenment in Protestant Britain was much more so a continuation of the Reformation than was the case in Catholic France, which sought instead to sever ties with and [purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dechristianization_of_France_during_the_French_Revolution) the Christian religion [entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e).\n\nCrucially, the very Christian tradition that Deneen claims to be rediscovering was itself the major driver of the British Enlightenment's high humanology, a fact which Deneen ignores.\n\nThe early Protestant reformers, Luther, Calvin, and Knox, simultaneously viewed human beings as a spark of the divine - \"[made in the image of God](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/man-as-the-image-of-god/)\" - as well as totally depraved and in need of supernatural grace.\n\nThe Biblical insistence on the radical equality and dignity of all human life is one of the most important declarations of the first few lines of Genesis. The implications of Genesis 1:27 have been debated for millennia, but the Reformed Protestant view that universal human worth derives from an innate spark of the divine sets a baseline of a relatively high humanology.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation's high humanology demanded that individuals were capable of a direct, personal connection with God and that this connection did not need to be mediated by a priest or religious superstructure. With freedom comes responsibility, and with the freedom to commune with God directly comes *great* responsibility. Of course, this freedom is only given by God through grace, but once given, it results in a radical transformation of individual responsibility and the importance of individual conscience.\n\nMartin Luther's [95 Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses), nailed to the door of Castle Church in Wittenburg just 15 years before Machiavelli's The Prince [was released](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince), did much more for the ushering in of modern liberal individualism than the Italian political scientist's book ever did.\n\nThe Reformation's elevation of individualism had profound social impacts. Literacy [spread rapidly](https://www.britannica.com/topic/education/Luther-and-the-German-Reformation) through Reformation countries, and a sense of [moral uprightness and stringent work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism) likewise became cultural cornerstones of the fledgling Protestant movement of the 16th century. For Protestants, freedom of conscience was inseparable from responsibility before God, so individualism and a high humanology became firmly embedded in the Protestant psyche.\n\nThat same high humanology traveled across the Atlantic with the Puritans and Quakers, deeply influencing America's founding ethos. Ultimately, the Reformation's high humanology characterized the American founding directly in the form of Puritan and Quaker influence and indirectly through the British Enlightenment, which also drew heavily on the high humanology of the Reformers.\n\nThe American founding's liberal individualism was not an Enlightenment invention in defiance of Christianity as Deneen argues. Instead, it was a result of a Protestant tradition dating back at least 250 years, that itself was based on Biblical texts dating back 2,500 years.\n\nDeneen's rejection of the British Enlightenment is also a rejection of the Protestant individualism that preceded it. Deneen, however, is Catholic, so perhaps he would be fine with this characterization.\n\n## Catholic High Humanology\n\nThe problem is, even if we go a step *further* back to the high point of medieval Catholic thought, we still find little support for Deneen's pessimistic low humanology.\n\nThomas Aquinas, despite explicitly being one of Deneen's major influences, has an even higher humanology than the early Protestant reformers.\n\nDrawing heavily from Aristotle, Aquinas was the intellectual force that finally unified Aristotelian virtue ethics with Christian theology. This great synthesis of Greek and Hebraic thought resulted in a view of human nature that held that humans are capable of pursuing the good (God) through reason and the cultivation of virtue. The Thomistic synthesis of Greek rationalism and Christian theology presupposes confidence in humanity's ability to fruitfully participate in the divine order.\n\nThis optimistic view of humans as capable of successfully pursuing a *telos* through reason and the understanding of natural law is completely at odds with Deneen's pessimism.\n\nFor Aquinas, like the Reformers, personal dignity is rooted in the *[Imago Dei](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/man-as-the-image-of-god/)*, and each individual is endowed with natural reason, making each individual morally responsible before God. Even though Deneen champions the virtue ethics and teleological thinking of the Thomists, his dismissal of human reason, individual agency, and rational optimism put him at odds with Catholicism's most important Doctor of the Church.\n\nThe search for Deneen's intellectual ancestors continues.\n\nPushing back further still, Saint Augustine, writing as the Roman Empire was crumbling around him in the early 5th century, did have a low humanology, believing that human nature is bent inward, prideful, and prone to disorder. This pessimistic view, however, was counterbalanced by Augustine's optimism surrounding *[The City of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_God)* and the eternal hope it provides.\n\nThe Augustinian synthesis of earthly pessimism counteracted by eschatological optimism ultimately inspired the early Protestant Reformers, especially Calvin, who primarily looked to Augustine as a model for his theology. Much of the Reformers' view of human nature was an explicit rejection of Aquinas's optimism and reliance on reason and natural law, and Augustine provided the Reformers with an alternative view to embrace.\n\nDespite Augustine's pessimism for earthly political projects, The Augustinian synthesis of earthly humility overwhelmed by the grace of God [ultimately inspired](https://voegelinview.com/jonathan-edwards-and-the-re-enchantment-of-the-saeculum-the-puritan-and-edwardsian-roots-of-the-idea-of-social-progress/) the Protestant Reformers and pushed the New England Puritans and Pennsylvania Quakers to embark on the great liberal experiment and found the \"[City Upon a Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_upon_a_Hill)\" in the first place. This teleological optimism also [played heavily](https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/res/article/view/4585) into the Progressive Era's social reforms, which provided for a [reinvention and evolution](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=upswing+by+robert+putnam&hvadid=678712461993&hvdev=c&hvexpln=0&hvlocphy=9028299&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=5859222027592172998--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=5859222027592172998&hvtargid=kwd-2242021715881&hydadcr=21346_13322475&mcid=661a1be647553582b1ca597fd036ed68&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_42njxpyfe8_e) of early 20th century liberalism.\n\nOnce again, we find that the roots of the British Enlightenment's high humanology runs deeper into the Protestant and Catholic past than Deneen cares to admit.\n\n## Does Anyone Hold to a Low Humanology?\n\nExpanding our search outside of Catholicism, there are several thinkers who embody Deneen's pessimism like Plato and Hobbes, but these thinkers are few and far between. In the case of Plato, Aristotle's more optimistic teleological approach rebutted [Plato's declinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies) quickly, and it was Aristotle's optimism that ended up being more deeply incorporated into Catholicism through Aquinas as previously discussed.\n\nHobbes likewise had a low view of human nature, but his ultimate solution was a strong monarchy capable of coercively forcing human cooperation. Deneen advocates for nothing close to monarchy, but many of his critics allege that a strong monarchy is the only natural conclusion to his anthropology. I don't entirely disagree. Ultimately, Deneen's list of low humanology allies is thin. Instead, the Protestant and Catholic tradition that supports a high humanology, whether through grace or through reason, is clearly the dominant view of the Western tradition. Deneen's thought therefore contradicts not only the American founding, but also the rich Judeo-Christian tradition that inspired it.\n\n## Summary\n\nDeneen's inevitably thesis argues that today's negative societal outcomes were unavoidable consequences of human nature in a liberal society, rather than the result of poor yet preventable choices. Deneen argues that Locke, Smith, and Madison gave us all cars but that our toddler nature made us all *innately* unequipped for that responsibility.\n\nUnfortunately for Deneen's argument, the Biblical and philosophical basis for the high view of human nature that drove liberal individualism runs extremely deep. The low humanology that Deneen assumes when arguing that individualism contains the seeds of its own destruction is based instead in a narrow strand of declinist thought.\n\nA high humanology and the moderated individualism it allows for is a consistent feature of Judeo-Christian thought dating back thousands of years. Both the early Protestant Reformers and Aquinas grounded their optimism in Biblical and philosophical texts thousands of years old, and even Augustine's earthly pessimism was balanced by an ultimate optimism that inspired the early Reformers and the Puritans. These various Christian influences were instrumental to American liberalism. Deneen's claim that this high view of human nature is a product solely of the Enlightenment doesn't stand up to theological or historical scrutiny.\n\nIf we have good reasons to believe in a relatively high view of human nature, then the argument that freedom inevitably leads to infantile hedonism falls apart. The vast majority of the theological and philosophical tradition of the West over the past 2,500 years supports a high humanology. Deneen's approach is therefore wildly out of step with not only the British Enlightenment but also the Christian tradition that he claims to be rediscovering.\n\nThe West's theological and philosophical foundations hold that humans are capable of rising to moral challenges, organizing communities, and mutually pursuing the good without the heavy hand of external coercion.\n\nOf course, being *capable* of pursuing the good doesn't mean that we always will. Virtue formation must be pursued and strong communities must be constructed in order to produce citizens who can handle freedom. Like teenagers, we are learning to drive imperfectly, but the Western tradition holds that we *can* successfully pursue the good and liberalism gives us the freedom to pursue it. We just need to choose to do so.\n\nOne could respond that just because Deneen is out of step with the broad Western tradition doesn't mean that he's wrong. It could be the case that he's right, and the Western tradition is wrong. This is true but unlikely. Even so, my third critique in Part III will deal with this response directly when we look at the actual track record of community formation within liberal societies.\n\n***\n\n*To read more and support or subscribe directly, find all of [Travis Monteleone's work on Substack](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/).*",
