  "body": "To hear Democrats in the US Senate, their insistence and support for the longest federal government “shutdown” in American history is all about health care. Specifically, they are holding federal employees and programs hostage over extending Obamacare subsidies - you know, “The (un)Affordable Care Act” - that were extended to upper middle-class and wealthier recipients _temporarily_ during the COVID pandemic.\n\nThat’s not what you’re being led to believe by Democrats or - _redundancy alert!_ - the legacy, “mainstream” media.\n\n[![Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., stands next to an easel during a press conference.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5OG0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa56bc3a-38b7-4bb7-a3db-73c5f94806fd_500x334.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5OG0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa56bc3a-38b7-4bb7-a3db-73c5f94806fd_500x334.jpeg)\n\nThose _temporary_ subsidies are (or were) due to expire at the end of the year. Senate Republicans and Democrats not-so-quietly negotiated behind the scenes on a plan to reopen the government in exchange for giving in to _some_ Democratic demands, while adding reforms to make it less expensive and less prone to fraud and abuse, which is rampant.\n\nWhat is also mainly going unreported, at least until this weekend, thanks in part to President Donald Trump, is that all the Democratic Obamacare subsidies for the wealthy would go to health insurance companies.\n\n> _One of Democrats’ worst COVID-19 power grabs was former President Joe Biden using the pandemic as cover to dramatically expand Obamacare through a scheme of temporary “enhanced” premium tax credits. Democrats removed all income eligibility limits on existing Obamacare tax credits - allowing those making upwards of $600,000 a year to receive taxpayer-subsidized health care coverage - and stripped out even modest cost-sharing for low- and middle-income Americans._\n>\n> _Furthermore, the Biden administration weakened eligibility verification safeguards, reduced tax reporting, and allowed insurance brokers to game the system by switching enrollees’ plans monthly. Not surprisingly, the program became another gravy train for waste and fraud. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports, in 2025 alone, 2.3 million people received credits for which they were not eligible, oftentimes by misreporting their income. In fact, the federal government pays out more subsidies than the entire number of people eligible for the program._\n>\n> _How does this happen? Many “free plan” enrollees are “phantoms”, with 40 percent of all enrollees having zero claims. That means millions never used or never realized they were “covered” while insurance companies happily raked in the taxpayer-subsidized premiums_\n>\n> [US Rep. Jody Arrington](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/3812381/obamacare-tax-credits-healthcare-costs/) (R-TX), Chair of the House Budget Committee\n\nLate on Sunday night, it sounds like the framework of a deal to reopen the government and extend Obamacare subsidies for the wealthy and [many other government health care program](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/extensions_divisions_authorizing_committees.pdf)s has been worked out. It includes four appropriations bills, including those for Agriculture (including food stamp or SNAP recipients), military construction projects, veterans programs, and (of course!) the legislative branch (funding for Congress), along with a new “continuing resolution” that funds the rest of the government into early next year.\n\nIt was never a secret that Many Republicans support extending, phasing out, and reforming those allegedly temporary Obamacare subsidies for the wealthy.\n\nThe reality is that Republicans, unable to agree on an alternative to Obamacare, have gone from wanting to repeal and replace it to now wanting to help “save” what’s left of Obamacare. Trump may have helped things along by calling for any extended subsidies to go to the individual Obamacare recipients, not the greedy insurance companies whose pockets Democrats want to line. Given the complexities of doing so, the urgency to fund parts of the federal government, including pay for air traffic controllers, the military, and about 40 million low-income Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients, greedy health insurance companies seem ready to win a $115 billion payday for the extension of Obamacare subsidies.\n\nThe US House, of course, will have to approve all this. That will be interesting, but I suspect Democrats will provide the votes for enactment without amendment, along with about 30 or so Republicans. Trump will most assuredly sign whatever Congress sends him. No doubt the media will trumpet Democratic spin that Republicans capitulated to their demands to “save health care.” For whom, you should ask, and _who pays_?\n\nIn a successful negotiation, both sides win, and that’s probably true here as well.\n\n> **“To retain respect for sausages and laws, one must not watch them in the making.”**\n>\n> Otto von Bismark\n\nEnding the shutdown will be nice, because as US Senator Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said over the weekend, the almost 40-day shutdown is approaching a national security crisis. I would also add, as someone scheduled to fly to Texas later this week for a family wedding, that there’s an air safety crisis looming, too. Air traffic controllers, stressed with long hours and challenging work conditions before the shutdown, are clearly beyond the breaking point. And many of us remember [a very tragic collision between a regional airline and military helicopter](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/30/deady-crash-reagan-national-00486001) at Washington, DC’s Reagan Airport on January 29.\n\n{{youtube:BAuup6riq8k}}\n\nDemocrats want more than Obamacare subsidies for the wealthy, of course, including reinstating Medicaid for non-U.S. citizens and able-bodied 18 to 64-year-olds. Those categories of people lost Medicaid under the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” or the budget reconciliation package passed earlier this year by Republicans over the unanimous opposition of Democrats. But they’re unlikely to get those extra couple of items, especially since they don’t poll well (as if people even know about that). The price tag for their extortion demands is $1.5 _trillion_ over 10 years, adding to our already bursting $38 trillion deficit. Only two months ago, we were at $37 trillion.\n\nThis expanding debt is mainly driven by the very thing Democrats want to explode even further and faster: government health care spending, especially for Medicare and Medicaid, along with demographic-driven growth of Social Security retirement and disability payments. Medicare (for people over age 65) and Social Security are funded mostly through their “trust funds,” both of which are on track to become insolvent within a decade.\n\nOf course, Democrats credit their efforts to “save health care” for wealthier Obamacare recipients for their political victories last week, driven by strong odd-year turnout among motivated, primarily, by urban and suburban Democrats. At the same time, mostly rural and exurban Republicans _stayed home_. My own view is that we owe the Democratic tide more to historic trends - the greater motivation of the party out of power to show up - than any particular issues beyond growing frustrations over affordability (higher housing, insurance, and utility bills, in particular) among younger urban professionals, especially younger adult white urban female liberals (YAWFULs).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b2FW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4fdcc2-a8d5-4541-b02e-5dcc8ee098f8_732x486.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b2FW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4fdcc2-a8d5-4541-b02e-5dcc8ee098f8_732x486.png)\n\nFrom a political perspective, despite the blatant failure of Obamacare and its misnamed Affordable Care Act, Democrats score way better than Republicans on the health care issue. That’s been true for a long time, and mostly because Democrats focus on it while Republicans have largely punted and run away, even now helping Democrats prop up a failed system. That, despite the fact that Democrats have made a mess of our health care system, which is now contributing to our exploding public debt.\n\nIt didn’t always used to be that way. Right after Democrat Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, on many of the same frustrations and some of the economic fears that we’re seeing today, he made it a point to call for “universal health care” and put First Lady Hillary Clinton in charge of a task force to achieve it. To his credit, Clinton invited Republicans to the White House in hopes of co-opting them into agreeing to the concept of “universal care.” Republicans didn’t say no, but chafed at the idea of a complex, top-down, government-run system.\n\nInstead, inspired a terrific expert at the once-great Heritage Foundation, they came up with a more free-market model for universal coverage that started by reforming the tax code, and empowered consumers with the freedom to buy and own the health insurance that best fits their needs; health insurance that is truly portable, and not tied to your job.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5i1s!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe304f068-26a0-4b24-983e-0247376555a3_680x549.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5i1s!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe304f068-26a0-4b24-983e-0247376555a3_680x549.png)\n\n{{caption:Many of these administrators are hired to contend with the complexities and overhead costs of working with health insurance companies and the government.}}\n\nJust like buying auto insurance today. _Only pay for what you need_, as one company advertises. Can you imagine shopping for health insurance the way you do for auto insurance? _I love the idea_. Maybe I’m the only one. Yes, I know —auto insurance rates are skyrocketing, too, thanks in large part to rising car thefts and expensive electric vehicle repairs.\n\nI’ll admit there are issues with the approach. By not having broad-based insurance plans where everybody subsidizes, say, childbirth, it becomes prohibitively expensive for those who need it. That’s why I like catastrophic plans with health savings accounts. You pay for the first $5,000 or $10,000 of medical expenses, then “catastrophic” insurance kicks in for anything above that, in most cases, 100 percent. Allowing employers and/or individuals to contribute up to $ 5,000 per year to tax-free HSAs will make that more palatable.\n\nI know there are those who disagree with this approach or have issues with it. Getting consumers to have “skin in the game” by contributing even modestly to their health care will reduce demand and cost. I’ll admit that’s not an easy sell, especially after the successful Zohran Mamdani “free stuff for everyone” mayoral campaign in New York. But we know that’s not going to happen. Nothing happens for free, including bus rides. Bus drivers and their vehicles don’t show up out of the goodness of their hearts. Somebody has to pay and many of those Mamdani wants to pickpocket are moving out of town. The only people who won’t leave are those who can’t afford to. Ask Camden, New Jersey, one of America’s poorest cities, how that’s worked out for them the past 60 years.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1C5W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1291d773-cb3f-47ef-a618-900f50448bbc_1080x790.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1C5W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1291d773-cb3f-47ef-a618-900f50448bbc_1080x790.webp)\n\nHow would you pay for this new approach? Two ways. First, amend the tax code. During World War II, with wages frozen, organized labor demanded better benefits from the Roosevelt Administration and the Democrats who controlled Congress. Democrats decided to give employers a tax exclusion for health insurance benefits that they provide to their employees. That works fine if your job is tied to a sizable company and you like it. But what if you’re self-employed, a small business, or _lose your job_?\n\nUnder the [Consumer Choice and Health Security Act](https://www.heritage.org/report/the-consumer-choice-health-security-act-s1743-hr-3698), authored by then-US Sens. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and US Rep. Cliff Stearn (R-FL), the bill would eliminate the tax exclusion to companies and allow them instead to give those dollars spent on health coverage to the worker in the form of taxable wages. Then, second, based on income, workers would receive a “refundable” tax credit to buy the health insurance _they_ need. Health plans would be regulated by the government, with Americans being required to obtain, at a minimum, a high-deductible “catastrophic” insurance plan to qualify for the tax credit. More about that “required” part in a moment.\n\n[![Bar graph of polling data from Navigator Research. Title: Democrats Lead On a Range of Economic Issues, Including Childcare, Health Care, Growing the Middle Class, & Housing](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TdGt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6809ffe-08ed-4906-998a-ede418ec4f04_500x281.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TdGt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6809ffe-08ed-4906-998a-ede418ec4f04_500x281.jpeg)\n\nThey would also be empowered to use tax credits to invest in tax-free Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), just like workers can do today, to help them cover deductibles and other qualified out-of-pocket expenses. No one could be turned down for insurance, and you’d have a bevy of plan options, just like government workers have today under the [Federal Employee Health Benefits Program](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/). Competition would help hold prices down, very much unlike the Obamacare “take it or leave it” approach today. The plan envisioned reductions in certain Medicare and Medicaid-related expenses to help pay for the tax credits.\n\nEmployees could even keep their employer-provided plans if they wanted. And trade associations and broad-based membership groups like the American Farm Bureau, National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), trade unions, and others could develop and market their own health insurance plans for its members.\n\nNo job? No problem, you’d still get a tax credit to cover your premiums and possibly part of your deductibles, if you invested the money into a tax-free HSA, which you can rollover year to year. Medicaid recipients could be included in the program, and states could be empowered to create “high-risk” pools with federal assistance for those with serious medical issues and expenses. It is even possible to imagine saving Medicare from insolvency by including it in the new system so seniors, too, could purchase the insurance they actually need (that was not in the bill). Tax credits would be based on the percentage of your income spent on health care-related expenses. The very wealthy would receive little or no subsidy. _Why should they?_\n\nMalpractice insurance reforms were also included that were anathema to trial lawyers, who have a lot of sway (and membership) in Congress, by limiting non-economic damages to $250,000. One controversial aspect of the initial legislation was its inclusion of an individual mandate to purchase health insurance. Ensuring full public participation helps make the numbers work, but it also gave pause to the libertarian-minded, who recoiled at government mandates to buy private insurance, even though it’s a common practice in many European countries, [such as Switzerland and the Netherlands](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/canadian-health-care-continues-perform-poorly-compared-other-countries). The individual mandate was dropped in a second version of the bill. It used to be part of Obamacare.\n\nThe Consumer Choice and Health Security Act was imperfect and needs updating, but it was good enough at the time to attract 24 Republican Senate sponsors - more than half the caucus when it was first introduced, including Senate GOP Leader and future Republican nominee for President, Robert Dole (R-KS), and other members of the leadership. Having that free-market alternative to “Hillarycare,” which inspired Obamacare, helped Republicans at least neutralize the issue and win control of Congress in the 1994 election.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ThVv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d10c9f3-fb2f-4bf7-afa3-e17f6fc42062_520x390.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ThVv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d10c9f3-fb2f-4bf7-afa3-e17f6fc42062_520x390.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The late US Sen. Arlen Specter, then a Republican from Pennsylvania, preparing for a failed presidential run, produced an organizational chart to underscore the complexity of Hillarycare. I still have the t-shirt. The Health Security Act was never enacted, but it helped spawn Obamacare.}}\n\nDemocrats hated the bill 1) because they didn’t think of it; 2) they wanted a top-down, government-run system that _they_ controlled; and 3) did not believe Americans were smart enough (I could stop there) to shop for and buy health insurance (no surprise there, since many Democrats think Americans are too stupid to get a voter ID). They also didn’t trust private health insurance companies (for some reason, they’re now fighting to subsidize them).\n\nA favorite “what if” involves the unemployed, imbecilic motorcyclist who carelessly rides around without a helmet and never gets health insurance. He finds himself in the hospital after crashing. In that case, he would be enrolled in a health insurance program, his tax credit covering his premiums, and most, if not all, of his bills would get paid. Today, hospitals mostly pad the bills of the insured to cover the cost of caring for the uninsured. You may consider that a slight difference, but I think it matters.\n\nSadly, Republicans were never able to enact the Nickles-Stearns bill, nor any of its successors that were largely based on its free-market model. Our allies, especially the health care industry, stood, arms folded, on the sidelines and were not very supportive. They’ve never liked the idea of competing (_I could stop there_) for consumer dollars, preferring instead the protection racket offered by The Nanny State.\n\nTrump 45’s efforts to repeal Obamacare without a unified GOP replacement led to the late Sen. John McCain [killing the repeal effort](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/344276-mccain-explains-why-he-voted-to-kill-obamacare-skinny-repeal/) in 2017, with his lone vote along with Democrats. Since the GOP has returned to its losing defensive posture on health care, it has never come as close to a unified reform bill as it did in those halcyon days.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HcEb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121fe311-460f-44d3-8c94-6b97c16908d8_680x470.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HcEb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121fe311-460f-44d3-8c94-6b97c16908d8_680x470.png)\n\n[You can read more about the 1993-94 legislation here](https://www.heritage.org/report/the-consumer-choice-health-security-act-s1743-hr-3698). It would need to be updated to reflect changes in the marketplace and government regulation, but its model remains an attractive alternative to failed Obamacare or a Canadian- or British-style “Medicare for All” system that would destroy innovation, result in lengthy wait times for non-emergency care, higher taxes, reduced quality and availability of care, and worse.\n\n> A recent study shows that the pluralistic public-private US system outperforms Canada on almost all key indicators of available health care resources. The US system even performs nearly as well as Canada in terms of providing effective health insurance coverage for its population.\n>\n> Americans spend 55 percent more than Canadians do on health care as a percentage of their national economy. Yet, the US has 327 percent more MRI units and 183 percent more CT scanners per population than Canada. The US also produces 100 percent more inpatient surgical procedures per population than Canada. Plus, American patients do not wait as long as Canadians for medical care; the US has 14 percent more physicians and 19 percent more nurses per population than Canada; US hospitals are newer and better equipped than Canadian hospitals; and Americans have access to more new medicines than Canadians.\n>\n> Canada’s Fraser Institute in 2008\n\n“If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it’s free,” the late PJ O’Rourke said. Former Newfoundland-Labrador Premier Danny Williams, a member of Canada’s Labor Party, [famously opted for life-saving heart surgery in the United States.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/williams-talks-about-u-s-heart-surgery-1.924467) The US-based [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/canada) opened operations in Canada about 20 years ago, as Canada moved to a two-tier medical system —one for the haves and another for the have-nots who don’t mind waiting 30 weeks for non-emergency surgery. That’s not uncommon in countries with “Medicare for All” systems, including Australia, and even the United Kingdom.\n\nDespite the flaws of our current health care system, it remains the world’s gold standard. By instilling old-fashioned free market competition, there will be pressure to keep costs low. And modest government regulation will police insurance companies to minimize the risk of consumer fraud.\n\nI’m no health policy expert. I didn’t write the bill, and you wouldn’t want me to write a new one (_I see many of you nodding vigorously_). But I could get excited about marketing a free-market-based health insurance model that makes it easy to shop and pay for only what I need. You know, like auto insurance, which many states _require_ you to buy or post a bond with the state. If I were a congressional or US Senate candidate, I’d certainly run on it.\n\nSuppose Republicans and even Democrats want to get serious about affordability. In that case, they need to address health care, which has only become more expensive as the government has intruded further into the system with subsidies, mandates, and regulatory burdens. Whether you’re talking about education (especially college tuition) or health care, the more the government spends and intrudes, the more expensive everything becomes.\n\nMore government is not the answer. The Affordable Care Act was anything but, and is a proven failure. And the framework for a solution might just be on the bookshelves, where it’s been collecting dust for about 32 years.",
