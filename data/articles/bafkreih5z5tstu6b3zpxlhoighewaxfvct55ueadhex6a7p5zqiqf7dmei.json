When Christ\n>\n> knelt before his judges,\n>\n> he didn’t say a word to them,\n>\n> a syllable.\n>\n> He tried, he is still trying\n>\n> to tell you: Your life\n>\n> is the miracle\n>\n> you think it is.\n>\n> Give it to the ones who do believe.\n\n(Reposted [with Joseph’s permission](https://x.com/lydialaurenson/status/1978167981692862515).\\[1])\n\n—\n\nSo many things go unspoken. I think a lot about mythic figures like the Six Silent Swans, a fairytale [ably retold by our own Sympathetic Opposition](https://www.sympatheticopposition.com/p/the-six-swans-and-the-silent-sister). It is the tale of a sister magically bound to stay silent, in order to heal her cursed brothers. Of the sister, Sympathetic Opposition notes: “As is so often the case, she could talk about the problem, or she could fix it.” And she remarks, “I see some wish fulfillment in the curse of silence. I get a little tired of words, and specifically tired of convincing people. When I feel like I have to, it’s easy to dream about being unable to.”\n\nCordelia is another one I think of, the youngest princess of Shakespeare’s “King Lear.” The tragedy begins with Lear bringing his three daughters together and demanding that they all tell him how much they love him. The two older sisters, both self-centered hypocrites accustomed to manipulating their father, each give to Lear an array of charming words. Then Lear turns to the youngest daughter, his favorite, expecting her to say something even more charming, but when he asks for words, Cordelia says she has none. He is enraged and disinherits her, and splits the entire inheritance between the two older daughters, who, since they are self-centered hypocrites, ruin the kingdom.\n\nCordelia, his only loyal child, the only person who truly loves the king aside from his loyal Fool, manages to save her father and restore order. She sacrifices her life to do it.\n\nSo many times I wonder if I am being asked to convince, and I cannot. Or do I decide not to? What I want, I think, is to be heard even when I say nothing.\n\nSo many things go unspoken, but I think the words I most often don’t say are along these lines: I love you.\n\n—\n\nAnother poem, this one by Sharon Olds:\n\n> **Sex Without Love**\n>\n> How do they do it, the ones who make love\n>\n> without love? Beautiful as dancers,\n>\n> gliding over each other like ice-skaters\n>\n> over the ice, fingers hooked\n>\n> inside each other’s bodies, faces\n>\n> red as steak, wine, wet as the\n>\n> children at birth whose mothers are going to\n>\n> give them away. How do they come to the\n>\n> come to the come to the God come to the\n>\n> still waters, and not love\n>\n> the one who came there with them, light\n>\n> rising slowly as steam off their joined\n>\n> skin? These are the true religious,\n>\n> the purists, the pros, the ones who will not\n>\n> accept a false Messiah, love the\n>\n> priest instead of the God. They do not\n>\n> mistake the lover for their own pleasure,\n>\n> they are like great runners: They know they are alone\n>\n> with the road surface, the cold, the wind,\n>\n> the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio-\n>\n> vascular health — just factors, like the partner\n>\n> in the bed, and not the truth, which is the\n>\n> single body alone in the universe\n>\n> against its own best time.\n\n(This is a poem often republished, so it’s probably okay for me to republish it here, but if someone associated with Olds tells me to take it down, I will.)\n\n—\n\nI have never really related to Sharon Olds’s famous poem, but there is something real to it: That sex is both among the people who do it and also about ourselves, our selves, and that it says something incontrovertibly true. “The truth,” she suggests, “the single body alone in the universe.” Yes, and no.\n\nI have rarely touched a man in this way without, in a way, falling in love with him. Is love even the right word? The language of a touch, the space between. Something unspoken.\n\n—\n\nI’ve played so many games of romance, which generally involve timing. I’ve said those words with perfect timing so many times. I wonder, sometimes, if I should ever say them to anyone, or always leave it unspoken.\n\n—\n\n•\n\n***\n\n\\[1] The first version of this post accidentally omitted the first line of Joseph’s poem.\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
