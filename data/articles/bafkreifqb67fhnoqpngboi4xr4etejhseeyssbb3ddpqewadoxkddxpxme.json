Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nAs an _options_ contract gives the buyer rights without any obligation, I'm giving you the same opportunity: before diving in, go back and read the prerequisite article, _From_ _[Lemonade Stands to Wall Street Flow](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/from-lemonade-stands-to-wall-street?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=truehttps://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/from-lemonade-stands-to-wall-street?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_. That _premium_ explanation _covered_ the basics, and now it's time to _exercise_ those definitions. I'm _calling_ it: you're ready to go.\n\n## The Monthly Paycheck Machines\n\nYour boss doesn't pay you once a year, so why should your portfolio? That's the appeal of **SPYI** and **QQQI**: two covered call ETFs that turn the S\\&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index into consistent monthly income streams. Together, they anchor the Tier 3 \"Enhanced Income\" bucket of my savings account known as my Short-Term Strategic Reserve. **SPYI** throws off \\~12% annualized yield while **QQQI** pays closer to \\~14%.\n\nThat translates to roughly 1% every month, and while the monthly payouts fluctuate a little, the averages hold firm, and that's what makes these funds reliable income machines.\n\n## How the Sausage Gets Made\n\nBoth ETFs sell index call options about 2–4% _out of the money_ on mostly one-month cycles (sometimes longer, 4–8 weeks). If the market drifts sideways or rises gradually, the funds capture option premiums and allow some upside. If the market suddenly rips higher, you cap any gains beyond that buffer.\n\nWhen managers _roll_ contracts, they close one option and open another with a new expiration or strike. That's how they keep the machine running without interruption. And here's the kicker: volatility makes them stronger. When markets become volatile due to recent threats from the orange tariff fairy (monster?) in the White House, the cost of betting on the future increases. Higher uncertainty means higher option premiums, and these funds collect the extra cash.\n\n## Have Your Income and Taxes Too\n\nMost covered call funds come with a side of tax-inefficient income surprises. Not here. Because NEOS uses **1256 index option contracts**, the majority of dividends are **return of capital.** Translation: you don't pay taxes now. Instead, distributions reduce your cost basis until it hits zero, usually in 8–9 years. After that, any gains are long-term capital gains and taxed accordingly. For years, you'll pocket extra income with little to no tax drag. Even though I'm in a relatively low bracket today, I aim to future-proof my investments and build positions designed to stay tax-efficient even as my income grows.\n\n_Tax rules with dividends deserve their own deep dive. I'll circle back with a full piece on that later._\n\n## Cash Flow With a Side of Growth\n\nThese aren't just income traps. Options written a few percent out of the money allow SPYI and QQQI to maintain room for price appreciation. In my account, both are up \\~5% in share price year-to-date on top of their monthly payouts. The S\\&P 500 is up roughly 9% this year, for reference.\n\n## The Catch\n\nCovered call ETFs aren't magic, and you should know how they behave in different markets:\n\n* **Down markets:** They fall with the index. No cushion.\n\n* **Flat markets:** They shine — steady, albeit lower, premiums.\n\n* **Slow, steady uptrend:** They thrive with modest growth + yield.\n\n* **Raging bull markets:** They lag, capped out while the index runs away.\n\nThat's the tradeoff: monthly checks in exchange for giving up explosive upside.\n\n## Who's Behind the Curtain\n\n**NEOS Investments**, a boutique firm specializing in **Next-Generation Options Strategies**, manages both funds. The leadership team, led by **Garrett Paolella** and **Troy Cates**, has a reputation for transparency. Garrett's interviews are worth watching if you want to hear the mechanics straight from the [source](https://youtu.be/y3WTECl7do0?si=Sl7vyduQslEdpnXz).\n\n_While your boss works you to the bone, you can be quietly stacking a cash flow stream that makes the job optional. Next week, I'll pull back the curtain on Tier 3.5, the high-octane world of options-based, alternative investment-linked income strategies._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
