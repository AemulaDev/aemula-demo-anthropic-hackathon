  "title": "The Jones Scandal and Problems with Early Voting",

  "body": "_“If those guys die before me,” (Jay) Jones wrote, referencing the Republican colleagues who were publicly honoring the deceased (Joe) Johnson’s memory, “I will go to their funerals to piss on their graves” to “send them out awash in something.”_\n\nReading that sentence in the _[National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dem-ag-nominee-jay-jones-fantasized-about-shooting-former-virginia-gop-speaker-he-receives-both-bullets/)_ story that broke the most significant political scandal of the 2025 election, I was immediately reminded of this scene from the famous Netflix series, “_[House of Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_\\(American_TV_series\\))_,” where Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, has just ascended to the presidency through scurrilous means and shows up to “pay respects” to his deceased father.\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weea3dQoqKk)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weea3dQoqKk) *[Frank Underwood pees on his father's grave! (house of cards)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weea3dQoqKk)*\n\n_House of Cards_, which launched in 2013, ran for six seasons, the last one without Spacey due to sexual abuse charges for which he was eventually exonerated. Beau Willimon, a former aide to US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), former Vermont Governor and presidential candidate Howard Dean, and Hillary Clinton wrote the series. Underwood, of course, was launched as a House Majority Leader and Democratic Congressman from South Carolina’s Fifth District before killing and scandalizing his way to the presidency.\n\nConsidering who Willimon worked for, it may not be too difficult to understand who inspired the Frank Underwood character. And perhaps it isn’t too hard to see who, or what, inspired Virginia’s Democratic nominee for Attorney General this year, Jay Jones, a golden boy of the Commonwealth’s Democratic party. At least, _was_.\n\nEven if you’re not from Virginia, perhaps you’ve been made aware of the former General Assembly Delegate, who has long been groomed for higher office in the Commonwealth. Just 36 years old, he unsuccessfully challenged then-incumbent Attorney General Mark Herring in the 2021 Democratic primary, despite Herring’s “black face” scandal from two years previous. Herring lost the general election to current Attorney General Jason Miyares, the son of a Cuban refugee, as the GOP statewide ticket, led by Glenn Youngkin, swept into office. Virginia Democrats cleared the field for the former State Delegate’s repeat run in 2025.\n\nJones has an impressive Democratic pedigree. The son and grandson of prominent Virginia Democrats - his father served as a Norfolk, Virginia Circuit Court Judge and seven terms in the General Assembly; his grandfather was a civil rights pioneer. Jay Jones also served two terms in the legislature from Norfolk, resigning in early 2022 to focus on his family.\n\nIt was just a few months later, according to _[National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dem-ag-nominee-jay-jones-fantasized-about-shooting-former-virginia-gop-speaker-he-receives-both-bullets/)_, that Jones engaged in an interesting text exchange with a Republican General Assembly delegate, Carrie Coyner. Some of the texts appear to have been [sent to Delegate Coyner by mistake](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/del-carrie-coyner-says-controversial-jay-jones-texts-were-mistakently-sent-to-her/65-f3c63315-f4c0-49d8-9a65-8fc7436f6c66).\n\n[![Comment Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rIqW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c897817-0bac-4823-aff4-6eb46ae16d1e_500x625.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rIqW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c897817-0bac-4823-aff4-6eb46ae16d1e_500x625.png)\n\nWhat prompted this? Then-Assembly Speaker Todd Gilbert (R-VA) said glowing things about a deceased Democratic colleague at his funeral.\n\nHe accused Speaker Gilbert of “breeding little fascists” who he also wanted to see die. “Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy,” Jones said. He called Gilbert, recently confirmed as the US Attorney for Eastern Virginia, and his wife “evil.”\n\nWhile a handful of Virginia Democratic officials, including his running mate, gubernatorial nominee and former US Rep. and CIA operative Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) criticized his remark, none have called for him to step down from the race, [including the Commonwealth’s Senior US Senator, Mark Warner](https://ijr.com/mark-warner-goes-silent-when-asked-if-hell-keep-fundraising-with-democrat-who-texted-murder-fantasies/) (D-VA), who in 2019 called on Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) to resign over a “black face” (I’m persuaded Northam is the guy in the KKK costume below, not the guy in black face) scandal involving a yearbook page from his medical school.\n\nWarner, who has also been [implicated in the Russia-collusion hoax](https://americaswatchtower.com/2018/02/08/mark-warner-was-texting-with-a-russian-lobbyist-about-the-dossier/) from 2016-17, is up for reelection in 2026.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eion!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd3216b5-5d67-42b4-aa9f-5726844e4b4a_677x450.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Eion!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd3216b5-5d67-42b4-aa9f-5726844e4b4a_677x450.jpeg)\n\nNearly every Republican, from President Donald Trump to US Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), has. Most of the people on Jay Jones’s official endorsement page, including my Congressman, Suhas Subramanyam (D-VA), have remained _silent and, therefore, complicit_.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wDKr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63505f-d0f3-4c29-afbc-6322168c2c04_1620x540.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wDKr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d63505f-d0f3-4c29-afbc-6322168c2c04_1620x540.png)\n\nThat’s a heavy dose of hypocrisy from the “words are violence” crowd. The [endorsement from US Senator Cory Booker](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5330512-cory-booker-endorses-jay-jones/) (D-NJ) is noteworthy because Jones endorsed _him_ during his 2020 contest for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n> _“Jay Jones will be a tireless fighter for Virginia families as Attorney General, and that’s why I’m so excited to announce my endorsement today,” Booker said in a statement. “Jay Jones has the vision, commitment, and integrity to keep families safe and make sure every Virginian gets a fair shake in the justice system. I’ll be working every day to ensure Jay wins this race.”_\n>\n> US Senator Cory Booker (D-VA)\n\nOne gun control group, Everytown for Gun Safety, quietly [withdrew the endorsement](https://freebeacon.com/democrats/sayonara-everytown-for-gun-safety-quietly-scrubs-endorsement-of-va-ag-candidate-jay-jones/) but has apparently not demanded that its $200,000 campaign contribution be returned. Another anti-Second Amendment organization, Virginians for Change - Action Against Gun Violence - continues to support Jones publicly.\n\nI guess “Virginians for Change” isn’t against _all_ gun violence.\n\nAnd this is but one of the shoes that have dropped on Jones’s campaign. It was also revealed, on October 1st, two days before the _[National Review’s](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dem-ag-nominee-jay-jones-fantasized-about-shooting-former-virginia-gop-speaker-he-receives-both-bullets/)_ story, that Jones was [convicted of reckless driving](https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/democratic-virginia-ag-nominee-convicted-in-2022-after-driving-116-mph-at-midnight-court-records-reveal/), caught driving 46 miles per hour over the speed limit on Interstate 64 (that’s 116 miles per hour) in New Kent County, between Richmond and Williamsburg.\n\nAs part of a very generous court settlement, Jones was ordered to do 1,000 hours of community service, which Virginia law stipulates must be done through nonprofit or governmental organizations. He credited himself with 500 hours by working for his own political action committee, “Meet Our Moment.” The PAC, by definition, is not a nonprofit. _He violated the terms of his settlement_.\n\nHow generous was Jones’s court settlement? Consider these [remarkably similar judgments against Virginia drivers](https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-residents-jail-time-reckless-driving-jay-jones-community-service-virginia-democrat-attorney-general-candidate-new-kent-county-speeding), as reported by WJLA’s Nick Minnock:\n\n> On the same day Jones received his sentence, a Woodbridge man was sentenced to 30 days in jail for driving 115 mph in a 70-mph zone. The Prince William County man’s sentence was suspended as long as he didn’t speed again. The Woodbridge man’s license was suspended for six months, then restricted, and he was fined $1,500.\n>\n> Another man was found guilty of reckless driving for driving 104 mph in a 70-mph zone in New Kent County. That earned him 20 days in jail, a six-month license suspension, and a $1,250 fine.\n\nRules for thee, not for me, I suppose.\n\nThe question, of course, is what effect all this will have on Virginia’s elections, which are less than a month away (New Jersey is the other state with competitive statewide elections on November 4th).\n\nFor at least [360,000 Virginians](https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2025-november-general-election/), it won’t matter, _because they’ve already voted_.\n\nVirginia is one of a couple of states with 45 days of early voting. It began on September 19th, 12 days before Jones’s scandals broke. That’s a lot of voters who cast their votes completely unaware of clearly disqualifying information. While there’s a good case to be made for early and absentee voting, 45 days is ridiculous. Most states provide up to two weeks. That’s sufficient, but don’t look for the Virginia General Assembly, controlled nominally by Democrats, to change that, despite a strain on local election offices and political parties to staff them with poll workers and watchers.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1O06!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae6248a-ea1d-4e01-957b-89e73d5593d8_1210x578.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1O06!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae6248a-ea1d-4e01-957b-89e73d5593d8_1210x578.png)\n\n*Source: Virginia Public Access Project*\n\nIndeed, most early voters are also the most partisan, and it appears the early voting is especially strong in traditionally GOP areas. It’s quite possible that no one’s vote, even those loyal Democratic voters for Jay Jones, would change with this new information. I hope someone does a public opinion survey of early voters in Virginia and asks them if the new disclosures might cause them to change their minds. _They can’t ask for their ballot back in Virginia once they’ve already voted._\n\nA similar survey was conducted in late October 2020, following the release of the Hunter Biden laptop story, which, of course, was heavily censored and throttled by every major social media outlet, as well as falsely debunked by much of the legacy media and a group of former national security officials. Seventy-nine percent of those surveyed say the Hunter Biden story, had it received the attention it deserved, [would have changed the outcome of the 2020 election](https://reclaimthenet.org/survey-americans-hunter-biden-latop-censorship-election).\n\nThere’s more evidence that history rhymes with respect to this election: the major media, other than the _Richmond Times Dispatch_ and a couple of regional television stations (especially Washington, DC’s WJLA), are [doing their best to throttle the story](https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-media-downplays-scandal-dem-virginia-ag-hopeful-jay-jones-texts-fantasizing-murder-gop-lawmaker). Reporters who shove microphones into the faces of every GOP Member of Congress every time Donald Trump or another GOP figure says something outrageous are curiously AWOL. It interests me that _National Review,_ a 70-year-old magazine of conservative opinion not known for “breaking stories,” broke this one. By and large, major media have largely suppressed the scandal.\n\nThere’s a good chance that, just now, Virginia voters are being made vaguely aware of the story.\n\nMost of the recent polling has the Democratic ticket ahead in all three statewide races. One had [Jay Jones leading incumbent Jason Miyares by 6 points](https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/10/06/cnu-poll-has-jones-leading-miyares-by-6-points-but-that-was-before-texts/) before the scandal broke. Whether these scandals will make a difference has yet to be seen, even if it appears obvious to people like you and me.\n\nBy the time you read this, Jones may have ended his campaign, but because early voting has already begun, he will remain on the ballot - _[Virginia Democrats can’t replace him if he were to drop out](https://www.thecentersquare.com/virginia/article_aadd72fa-3d42-41f3-95cc-271ef68515ff.html)_. If Jones withdraws and still wins, the seat would be declared vacant, and a special election would be held to fill the vacancy. That’s perhaps why they’re in damage control mode and continue to stand by their man.\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc4e-HdlhPY)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc4e-HdlhPY) *[Tammy Wynette-Stand By Your Man (60's)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc4e-HdlhPY)*\n\nVirginia’s Democrats have cloaked themselves in shame and disgust for failing to vet their nominee, and worse, brushing off his remarks. They appear complicit in Jones’s musing to murder a political opponent and his children, and his favorable legal treatment when caught reckless driving, which sends many others to jail. Given the recent explosion of left-wing violence, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised.\n\nMy Commonwealth of Virginia deserves better. Or, do we? The election results will tell us. The behavior and reaction of Virginia Democrats, across the board, have been shameful and disqualifying. They’ll have to decide whether they want to be the party of native son Thomas Jefferson or Frank Underwood. Thus far, they’re leaning towards the latter.",
