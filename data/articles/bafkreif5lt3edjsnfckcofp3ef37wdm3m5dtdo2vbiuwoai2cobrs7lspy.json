Today he wrote about our K-shaped economy, and I knew exactly what he meant. It’s the moment you flinch at the total in your grocery cart, quietly decide to skip dinner out, and then scroll past headlines about Jeff Bezos’s $500 million yacht or Donald Trump’s $400 million ballroom. Two stories, same country, same day. They don’t connect—but they absolutely belong together.\n\nA K-shaped economy is what happens after a shock—war, recession, pandemic—when the recovery splits. One group climbs upward: incomes rise, assets grow, choices expand. Another group flattens or slides backward: wages lag, jobs get harder to find, costs pile up. Draw those paths on a chart and they form a K. One line up. One line down. One economy moving in two directions at once.\n\nThat difference matters because it explains a feeling millions of people recognize instinctively. The economy can look strong in headlines while daily life feels tighter, more fragile. Growth is happening—but not for everyone, and not in the same way.\n\nThis wasn’t always the American pattern.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States faced an economic shock far larger than anything since. Factories ran around the clock. Labor was scarce. Inflation threatened to surge. The federal government intervened directly, not delicately. Through the National War Labor Board, wage increases at the top were capped while lower-paid workers were allowed to catch up. Union membership exploded. Wage gaps narrowed sharply across the economy¹². For roughly thirty years after the war, productivity and pay rose together. The K barely existed.\n\nThat era ended not because it failed, but because policy changed.\n\nIn 1981, Ronald Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking air traffic controllers. It was a single act with a long shadow. Employers took the signal. Union power declined steadily. Wage-setting shifted from collective bargaining to individual negotiation. Capital gained flexibility; workers lost leverage. Growth continued, but recoveries began tilting upward³.\n\nWhen Youngstown Sheet & Tube closed its Campbell Works in 1977, 5,000 jobs vanished in one announcement. The company remained profitable. Workers were given no warning and no stake. Courts rejected efforts to keep the plant operating. Communities learned that companies could recover without them—and often did.\n\nThe George W. Bush years hardened that lesson. Large tax cuts skewed toward high earners, two prolonged wars, and financial deregulation preceded the 2008 collapse. When the housing bubble burst, middle-class wealth evaporated. Black households lost roughly half their net worth. The stock market recovered in a few years. Wages and job security took far longer⁴. It was a K-shaped recovery before the phrase entered common use.\n\nBarack Obama entered office amid that wreckage. His administration stabilized the financial system, rescued the auto industry, and passed a stimulus large enough to stop a depression. Unemployment fell steadily. But the recovery was cautious. Fiscal support faded early. Labor markets healed slowly. Asset prices rebounded faster than wages. Inequality stopped exploding, but it didn’t meaningfully reverse. Obama himself later warned that an economy delivering growth without broad participation was courting instability⁵.\n\nDonald Trump inherited a long expansion and promised disruption. What followed was volatility. Corporate tax cuts boosted profits and stock buybacks. Tariffs were imposed, threatened, reversed, expanded, and litigated. Businesses responded predictably: they delayed hiring and long-term investment. Gains flowed upward. Bargaining power stayed weak. Then COVID arrived.\n\nThe early pandemic economy was the most visibly K-shaped downturn in modern history. Professional workers logged on from home. Service workers lost jobs overnight. Equity markets surged under massive monetary support. Food bank lines stretched for miles.\n\nAnd then, briefly, the fork bent.\n\nUnder Joe Biden, the federal government chose scale over caution. The American Rescue Plan delivered direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, expanded child tax credits, and aid to state and local governments. When the economy reopened, labor demand surged. Employers competed for workers.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, wages at the bottom rose faster than wages at the top. Black unemployment reached record lows. Job switching accelerated. Economists documented a measurable compression of wage inequality—something many had assumed globalization had made impossible⁶.\n\nThis is the part that matters most. The K is not inevitable. It responds to policy and power.\n\nWhen labor markets are tight, the K contracts. When hiring freezes replace layoffs, the K hardens. When uncertainty favors waiting over investing in workers, the upward arm keeps moving while the lower arm stalls.\n\nThat’s why Krugman’s column resonates so sharply. People aren’t angry because wealth exists. They’re angry because they’re cutting back while being told the economy is booming.\n\nA K-shaped economy isn’t just about inequality. It’s about direction—who gains momentum and who loses it, who can plan and who simply reacts.\n\nWe’ve lived through this fork before. We’ve also lived through periods when it narrowed. The difference has never been abstract economics. It has always been whether shared recovery was treated as a goal—or whether divergence was accepted as collateral damage.\n\nBecause if the K keeps widening, it won’t remain a metaphor. History suggests it never does.\n\n⸻\n\nBiibliography\n\n1\\. Goldin, Claudia, and Robert A.
