Donald Trump has launched a broad—very likely constitutionally illegal—land assault on Venezuela and claims to have captured Nicolás Maduro, the country’s president, along with his wife. The immediate question is why. It isn’t drugs; that rationale collapsed years ago. It may involve oil interests, which would surprise no one. But there is something else at work here, something more consistent and more troubling. Trump needs to attack someone. It isn’t strategy so much as instinct.\n\nThat distinction matters, because it explains far more than any single justification offered this morning. For Donald Trump, attack is not a tactic pulled out when circumstances demand it. It is his governing mode. Restraint does not register as prudence; it registers as humiliation. Institutions that slow him down become enemies. Allies that expect reciprocity become weak. Facts that complicate the story become lies. And adversaries—especially those that can be reduced to a single, morally uncomplicated villain—become necessary.\n\nVenezuela has filled that role for years. Under Nicolás Maduro, it has been Trump’s favorite shorthand for everything he wants Americans to fear: “socialism,” collapse, criminality, disorder. Whether the stated rationale today is narcotics trafficking, regional security, or energy supply is almost beside the point. Trump governs through confrontation because confrontation produces motion, loyalty tests, and spectacle. It creates the appearance of control.\n\nIn Caracas, the experience was not ideological. Windows rattled. People woke to a layered concussion that moved through walls rather than a single clean blast. Smoke rose toward La Carlota, the military air base that has long been part of the city’s visual landscape. Local reporting captured the moment with blunt accuracy: there was still no official information¹. In the hours after force is used, silence becomes its own weapon. A city waits not for truth, but for the loudest voice.\n\nThat voice came quickly, and it came from Washington. Trump announced the capture himself, via social media, before independent confirmation was possible². U.S. officials framed the operation as law enforcement—an arrest, not an invasion—tied to a long-standing indictment alleging narco-terrorism². Venezuela’s vice president responded with a demand that cut through the abstractions: proof of life². When a leader disappears and the first request is proof of life, the argument has moved beyond policy. It has entered the realm of raw power.\n\nThe historical parallel surfaced almost immediately. The closest precedent is Panama in 1989, when U.S. forces invaded to capture Manuel Noriega, also under indictment³. That episode is remembered in Washington as decisive; in much of Latin America, it is remembered as a violation that never quite closed. The lesson was not simply that the United States can remove a leader. It was that once removal becomes a tool, legality becomes something to be argued after the fact.\n\nFor people in Caracas, legality was not the first concern. They worried about checkpoints, power cuts, and whether the next blast would land near a school¹³. Smoke does not explain itself. It lingers in the throat and turns the body into a sensor for someone else’s decisions. The city waited for a story strong enough to impose order on the night, even if that order was manufactured.\n\nThis is where Americans tend to misread events like this one. We treat foreign policy as a separate domain—maps, briefings, experts—when in fact this operation follows the same logic Trump has applied at home for nearly a decade. His attacks on the press were not emotional outbursts; they were instruction. By labeling journalists “the enemy of the American people,” he trained his audience to distrust any account not delivered by him⁴. Analysts at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center have described this language as a classic authoritarian tactic, designed to delegitimize independent sources of truth until only the leader’s narrative remains credible⁵.\n\nPolitical scientists describe this as personalist power: systems organized around loyalty rather than competence, unpredictability rather than rules. Leaders operating this way are always fighting two battles—one against the public, another against elites who might restrain or replace them. Milan Svolik’s work on authoritarian rule shows how spectacle functions as a signal in these systems, reassuring supporters while warning potential rivals⁶. A dramatic foreign strike speaks to both audiences at once.\n\nForeign conflict also offers scale. Fewer referees. Bigger stages. A strike abroad can be sold as decisiveness without the inconvenience of domestic due process. An announced capture can substitute for evidence. The press conference becomes the verdict.\n\nYes, Venezuela also sits atop valuable oil, and there are global interests eager for normalization if sanctions ease⁷. That explains who stands ready to benefit. It does not explain why escalation takes this form, at this moment, with this presentation. Interests explain persistence. Instinct explains timing.\n\nSeen this way, today’s operation is less a response to new intelligence than a demonstration of method. If attack is the model, Venezuela is the stage. The message is not only to Caracas. It is to allies expected to accept unilateral action, to institutions expected to keep up, and to domestic audiences invited—once again—to confuse motion with control.\n\nAs the morning wore on in Caracas, the smoke thinned¹. It did not disappear; it spread, diluted into the day the way shocks often do. Glass stops vibrating because glass is honest. It responds to force and then waits.\n\nGovernance by assault leaves the same residue. The boundary between domestic performance and foreign action erodes. Verification becomes hostility. Power announces itself and dares anyone to question it.\n\nIf attack is the instinct, the question is no longer whether the air clears. The question is where the next plume will rise—and how many people will learn, too late, that the glass can rattle anywhere.\n\nSources:\n\n1\\.
