Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nDo you remember when you were a kid and your mom would pull out all the lasagna dishes, takeout boxes, and whatever else was left in the fridge to piece together dinner? A bunch of little scraps that somehow added up to a full meal.\n\nThat's where we're at today. I capped the _Spend & Save_ series last week with _[Peak Spend & Save](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/peak-spend-and-save?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true),_ but I've still got a few morsels left to share. Consider this the financial leftovers edition. While credit card rewards are the flagship way to squeeze extra cash out of your spending, there's a whole smorgasbord of small apps and micro-income plays that quietly add up. Think walking apps, survey apps, and cashback platforms. They're not glamorous, but they're easy, and they work.\n\n### Steps = Cash?!\n\nImagine getting paid just for walking around campus or filling out a one-minute survey. That's the whole game here. I've tested plenty of these, and while some (most) are garbage, these four have actually paid me real money:\n\n* **[Cashwalk](https://cashwalkus.onelink.me/CT5i/9nd4x2ye?af_force_deeplink=true\\&deep_link_sub2=VWZQR)**: 1 point per 100 steps. 5,000 points = a $5 Apple gift card. About 2 minutes of effort daily. Easy if you're already hitting 10,000 steps, like me, around campus. \\~1 gift card/month.\n\n* **[WeWard](https://wewardapp.go.link/16vgU?label=TenaciousZebra8482)**: Same step-to-points deal. Watch one short ad daily to collect points. \\~$10/month to PayPal.\n\n* **[Evidation](https://api.us.evidation.com/refer/X77l2907)**: A unique app that serves as a health tracking platform, offering points for logging sleep, mood, and stress, as well as steps, workouts, and other exercises. \\~$10/quarter to PayPal.\n\n* **[Google Opinion Rewards](https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/)**: Short surveys every few days, $.10–$1 each. \\~$15/month to PayPal and takes less than 5 minutes each time.\n\n### Cashback Platforms\n\nIf walking around isn't part of your daily agenda, these apps quietly juice the money you're already spending:\n\n* **[Benjamin](https://benjaminone.onelink.me/J580/0dvdok5g)**: Daily cashback bonuses after watching an ad and a small % back on all spending. \\~$25/month to the bank. _Requires a linked card; minimum payout is $25._\n\n* **[Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/CRAWFO4225?eeid=45830)**: Use for online shopping. A simple browser extension allowed me to receive 3% extra back at Best Buy on a RAM upgrade, in addition to the cash back on my card. Pays quarterly to PayPal. \\~$40/quarter.\n\n* **[Fetch](https://referral.fetch.com/vvv3/referralqr?code=FE5VN4)**: Scan receipts, cash out for Starbucks or Apple gift cards. \\~$5/month.\n\n* **[Upside](https://upside.app.link/CRAWFORD2845)**: Link card, buy gas, get cash back. $10 minimum cash out. \\~$10 every two months.\n\n### Leftovers Worth Keeping\n\nNone of these apps will make you rich. But for minimal effort, they can pay for a few coffees, a streaming bill, or even a small portfolio contribution. The trick is to avoid falling into their marketing traps—buying products to score \"bonus points\" is a losing game. Pick the ones that fit your lifestyle. Walkers and drivers? Cashwalk and Upside. Online shoppers? Rakuten. Everyone? Fetch, because receipts are receipts, digital ones count too! Shameless self-plug: click the embedded links for each app, and I'll receive a referral bonus - another great micro-income opportunity!\n\nThese micro streams can quietly compound into tens of thousands over decades. Next week, _The Core Curriculum: The 25-500 Plan_ begins, where we move from lasagna scraps to a five-course feast.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
