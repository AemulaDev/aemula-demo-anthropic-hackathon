  "body": "A couple people I know recently put together a three-month-long coaching program called [Reconstellation](https://www.supercycle.org/reconstellation), with the tagline “forge better life strategies through creativity.” This is the first program like this that they’ve done, and they invited me to be a “featured established creator.”\n\nThere are still some spots left in the program. It is application-based, and if you’re interested then you can [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdhCq0YCiUMhnTXopUOFfXZLUnrTAnorzFlAwr8BbQZhkEHw/viewform) (deadline December 15th).\n\nNote: If you are a paid subscriber to my Substack and you join Reconstellation, then they’ll give you a 15% discount! It’s a small program, so there isn’t a code for this or anything — if you want to claim the discount, just email me and I’ll let them know.\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
