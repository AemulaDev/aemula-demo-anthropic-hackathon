Overhead, fluorescent lights buzzed with a low hum that seemed to pulse in rhythm with the rows of tabulators warming up for early voting. A poll worker adjusted her headset, tapped a key on a scanner, and gave a nod to the technician across the room. Another monitor blinked green. The machines were ready—but something else had already been set in motion.\n\nOutside public view, the 2025 and 2026 elections were being quietly reengineered—not through debate or reform, but through acquisition, regulation, and executive command.\n\nIn early October, Dominion Voting Systems—long a target of conspiracies peddled by allies of Donald Trump—was sold to a new entity called Liberty Vote. The buyer: Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election official and founder of KNOWiNK, maker of the nation’s most widely used electronic poll books. With the acquisition, one GOP-aligned executive gained operational influence over both voter check-in and ballot tabulation in overlapping jurisdictions across 14 states, including the entire state of Georgia¹.\n\nElection integrity experts raised immediate concerns. When check-in and counting systems are controlled by the same entity, redundancy and transparency are compromised. “It’s not the machines that worry me,” said an election tech trainer during a statewide seminar, “it’s the business chain. When one vendor runs both systems in a precinct, there’s no second look.” _The consolidation of power inside the electoral process isn’t theoretical anymore—it’s architectural._\n\nA Liberty Vote spokesperson responded that the company is “committed to transparency, resilience, and compliance with all federal and state certification standards.”\n\nWithin days of the Dominion sale, another move drew national attention. Kurt Olsen, sanctioned in multiple courts for filing false claims while representing Trump-aligned candidates after the 2020 election, was appointed to a White House post focused on “election integrity.” His assignment includes reviewing 2020 voting equipment, investigating registration systems, and accessing sensitive federal election data—despite courts repeatedly rejecting his prior attempts to invalidate state-certified results².\n\nThese maneuvers fit a broader pattern. Following his return to office, Trump signed an executive order restricting mail-in ballots, promoting hand-marked paper ballots, and proposing federal oversight of state-run voting systems—authorities the Constitution does not grant the executive branch³. The White House also began defunding cybersecurity and foreign interference units in DHS and DOJ, while deploying masked federal officers to “protect election sites” in Democratic-leaning urban areas⁴.\n\n_What began as bluster is now codified policy._ A Justice Department memo circulated in July confirmed that criminal referrals would target nonprofits and registration groups suspected of “ballot interference”—a term left intentionally vague. Meanwhile, the DOJ under Attorney General Pam Bondi began compiling a national voter database using subpoenas and lawsuits, pressuring states to comply or risk federal funding cuts.\n\nIn Georgia, one of the states now using both Liberty Vote tabulators and KNOWiNK poll books statewide, the entire voting infrastructure runs through a single-source vendor system. During the June 2020 primary, poll book failures led to hours-long lines in majority-Black precincts. A federal judge required paper backups after 2020⁵. In 2024, the state board repealed the rule, only to be overruled—a cycle of policy whiplash still unresolved in 2026.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the same quiet consolidation is underway. Lexington town records confirm use of ImageCast tabulators (formerly Dominion) and KNOWiNK Poll Pads. Boston uses the same systems citywide⁶⁷. In both cases, voter check-in and ballot counting now rely on a shared vendor pipeline—a fragile design should any component fail, be compromised, or become a target of litigation.\n\nAcross multiple swing states, legislatures aligned with Trump’s electoral agenda have passed or proposed measures enabling local boards to delay or refuse certification of results. In Cochise and Pinal counties, Arizona, and in Fulton County, Pennsylvania, these tactics have already disrupted the certification timeline. Courts issued sanctions in some cases, but the procedural uncertainty persists⁸.\n\n_In the modern information cycle, delay is the narrative—even if overturned._\n\nMeanwhile, Liberty Vote has pledged to introduce a new suite of American-made systems aligned with Trump’s executive order. But any substantive changes to hardware or code must pass federal and state certification standards. That process can take months—or years. Philip Stark, a professor of statistics and pioneer of risk-limiting audits, called the timeline “absurdly unrealistic,” noting that new staffing or code rewrites would reset the entire testing and approval cycle⁹.\n\nMost jurisdictions will likely head into the 2026 midterms using existing Dominion infrastructure rebranded as Liberty Vote. That includes software developed in Belgrade, Serbia—a fact often weaponized in right-wing conspiracy narratives, yet now ignored by those same voices due to the change in ownership¹⁰.\n\nRisk-limiting audits (RLAs), logic-and-accuracy testing, and ballot custody procedures remain the frontline defenses. But not all states require them. And where both poll books and tabulators fall under the same vendor umbrella, independent validation becomes more difficult if the chain of custody is compromised at either end.\n\n_This is the new frontier of election manipulation—not changing votes, but changing trust._\n\nWhat once relied on distributed roles—separate hardware vendors, state oversight, independent auditing—has begun to collapse into a vertically integrated framework controlled by a narrow circle. That doesn’t require malice to be dangerous. A well-timed outage, a delay in certification, or even the threat of litigation can fracture confidence in a system designed to project finality.\n\nIn 2025, the battle over elections isn’t just about ballots. It’s about gatekeeping—who checks in voters, who codes the firmware, who certifies the tabulators, and who refuses to sign off on the result.\n\nAt the close of the day in one precinct, the last ballot slid through the scanner. The machines powered down. The room went still.\n\nThe overhead hum remained.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1 _One Republican Now Controls a Huge Chunk of US Election Infrastructure,_ _Wired_, Oct. 16, 2025.
