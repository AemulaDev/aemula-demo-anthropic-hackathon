  "body": "The world is full of evil words and evil deeds.\n\nPeople say and do things to each other that are hurtful and wicked.\n\nBattle lines are drawn up; whose side are _you_ on? Or are you sitting on the fence and thus complicit with evildoers?\n\nAnd even if you are on the right side, are you denouncing the other side with sufficient anger?\n\nIt seems that we have to be maximally angry at those we deem to be “evil,” and use the harshest language possible to describe their actions and condemn them.\n\nTerms like “racism” and “genocide” are thrown out without any thought to the boundaries of such terms. Such words are used as “language nooses” to “hang” those we have condemned as guilty.\n\n_But what have they done, and does it warrant a “social death penalty?” Could they have done worse deeds for that same penalty?_\n\nTonight, I looked up the expression “might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb.” The meaning of this expression is that if committing a relatively minor offense earns the same penalty as a more serious offense, you might as well go ahead and commit the more serious offense. When we accuse people with the strongest terms possible, we provide perverse incentives for our opponents to abandon restraint. After all, what worse could be said about them? What worse could be done to them?\n\nThere is something else that should be kept in mind when confronting evildoers: In Revelation 12, Satan is referred to as the “accuser of our brothers.” The word translated as “accuser” is the word _kategor_, from which the English word “category” is derived.\n\n**To confront those who behave badly, we must have proper categories if we wish to see improved behavior.**\n\nThis means that the terms we use for bad behavior must be well-defined, and those terms should match the severity of the offense. Terms associated with extreme severity should not be used for behavior that could be much worse, and terms that imply malicious intent should not be used for behavior or speech that could have more benign possibilities.\n\nBeing merciful in our speech isn’t just about the Golden Rule. It also discourages people from being the worst they could possibly be.\n\nLet’s encourage each other to be better.",
