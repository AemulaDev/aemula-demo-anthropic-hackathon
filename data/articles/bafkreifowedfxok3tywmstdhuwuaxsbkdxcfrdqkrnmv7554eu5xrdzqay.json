Early one morning in October, more than a hundred federal agents from Border Patrol, the FBI, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives broke down the doors of the complex in a raid that lasted hours. They dragged dozens of people — men, women, children — into unmarked vans. Witnesses told reporters some were still naked, taken from showers or beds. Children were separated from parents. No agency confirmed it. But the smell was real, and it stayed.\n\n“Terrible things are happening outside. Poor helpless people are being dragged out of their homes… Children come home from school to find that their parents have disappeared,” Anne Frank wrote in her diary in 1944⁷. Nearly 80 years later, Joyce Vance — former U.S. Attorney and law professor — recalled Frank’s words after the South Shore raid and asked: \\*“Are we the Nazis now?”\\*⁷\n\nDHS claimed the raid was linked to a Venezuelan gang, _Tren de Aragua_, but offered no proof that those arrested were members. No names were released. No charges announced. Alicia Brooks told ABC7 she was dragged from her doorway as her children screamed. Neighbors used words like _war zone_ and _occupation_.\n\nThe language of the press release was cleaner. “Operation targeting known associates.” “Security operation.” “Public safety.”\n\nThe language is always clean. “Interference.” “Detention.” “Compliance.”\n\nBut history doesn’t smell like language. It smells like bleach in a stairwell.\n\nIt was a smell familiar to anyone who has lived near the edge of state violence — the residue of order imposed by force, the aftermath of something that cannot quite be scrubbed clean. And it’s not the first time.\n\nIn 1936, Oswald Mosley led the British Union of Fascists through London’s East End, a neighborhood of immigrants, Jews, and leftists. He called it a “unity march.” His shirts were black, his boots polished. But the people of Cable Street knew what they were looking at, and they didn’t let it pass.\n\nMothers threw bottles from balconies. Carpenters chained doors shut. Socialist dockworkers formed barricades with overturned wagons and wood planks, locking arms beside Irish Catholics and anarchists and Jews. After six hours, the police — not the fascists — were forced to retreat.\n\nThey passed the Public Order Act the next year.\n\nThe pattern didn’t end in Britain. In 1939, Franco’s forces swept into Madrid with German and Italian bombers at their back. Entire neighborhoods were erased. Spanish anti-fascists had fought for three years without foreign support. Volunteers from the U.S., Britain, and fifty other countries — the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the International Brigades — tried to help. Most were killed or exiled. Franco remained in power until 1975.\n\nThere were no parades for the men who tried to stop him. Some were denied passports, branded traitors, or targeted during the McCarthy era⁵.\n\nIt’s always been this way. Each era renames the same reflex — offering a new symbol, a new scapegoat — but the pattern of power, cruelty, and normalization remains.\n\nAmerica has never been immune. In 1933, the American Legion marched in uniform past the White House. Some leaders admired Hitler’s tactics. In 1939, 20,000 rallied at Madison Square Garden beneath a giant swastika and an American flag. The speaker’s podium had a portrait of George Washington.\n\nAnd as the decades marched forward, so did the tactics of suppression. In 1969, FBI agents broke into Fred Hampton’s apartment in Chicago and shot him in his bed. His crime was breakfast. He was feeding children.\n\nTen years later, in 1979, Klansmen and Nazis gunned down five protestors in Greensboro, North Carolina. The police were told of the planned attack and stood down. The killers were acquitted by an all-white jury.\n\nThen, in 2020, federal agents in Portland abducted protestors into unmarked vans, firing munitions at medics and mothers. The mayor was tear-gassed. The president called it “law and order.”\n\nAnd what of those who refuse? What name do we give the ones who block the march, who throw the bottle, who chain the doors shut?\n\nSome say Antifa. Others say troublemakers. But history has another word: people.\n\nPeople who say no.\n\nIt’s not a brand. It’s not an organization. It’s a pattern of refusal.\n\nEven the FBI, in 2020, made that distinction. Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress that Antifa was “an ideology or a movement, not an organization”⁹. But that hasn’t stopped politicians and media from naming it as something more concrete — a villain with a membership card, a scapegoat for unrest.\n\nThis confusion, deliberate or not, has a purpose. It criminalizes dissent. It transforms moral reflex into public threat. It makes the act of resistance — of saying _no_ — seem dangerous.\n\nThat tactic is not new either.\n\nUmberto Eco warned long ago that fascism would not return in uniform. It would not wear swastikas or goose-step down Pennsylvania Avenue. It would come with flags and slogans and “the promise of order.” It would come disguised as national pride².\n\nToday, it comes with a badge and bleach.\n\nAnd the ones who see it — the ones who throw the bottle or yell from the balcony or link arms at the barricade — are called Antifa. Not because they joined something, but because they refused something.\n\nWe have smelled it before.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n¹ Paxton, Robert O. _The Anatomy of Fascism_. New York: Alfred A.
