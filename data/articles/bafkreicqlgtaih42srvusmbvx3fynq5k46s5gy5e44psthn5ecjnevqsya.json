She began with a list.\n\n“He has refused his assent to laws,” she said. “He has obstructed the administration of justice. He has made judges dependent on his will alone. He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.”¹\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, read aloud in a room with fluorescent lights and a state seal on the wall, two and a half centuries after it was written. Staffers were still finding their seats. Aides were still opening folders. Sherrill did not wait. She read the charges as if they had been written for the moment, not the museum.\n\nShe did not say Donald Trump’s name. She did not need to. Everyone in the room understood why a new governor would open her term by reading an indictment of a king.\n\nWhat she did not quote was the part of the founding story that feels less like marble and more like splintered wood.\n\nBefore the Revolution was arguments in pamphlets, it was strangers in your home.\n\nIn 1761, fifteen years before Jefferson drafted the Declaration, a thirty-year-old Boston lawyer named James Otis stood in a crowded courtroom to argue against what were called writs of assistance. They were not warrants in any modern sense. They named no house, no person, no crime. They allowed customs officers to enter any home or warehouse, at any time, to search for smuggled goods.\n\nOtis did not argue in theory. He argued in rooms.\n\nHe described doors opened without warning, desks emptied without explanation, families made to stand aside while strangers read their letters. He called the writs “the worst instrument of arbitrary power” in English law, and John Adams later wrote that this argument was the moment the American Revolution truly began.²\n\nThe British had soldiers in Boston, but it was the searches that made people feel conquered.\n\nA house, Otis said, is a man’s castle. A government that can enter it at will does not simply enforce law. It teaches people where they stand.\n\nWhen the Fourth Amendment was written years later, it did not read like political philosophy. It read like damage control.\n\n“The right of the people to be secure … against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” the founders wrote, and then they added the machinery: probable cause, oath or affirmation, particular description.³ They were not designing elegance. They were trying to prevent a memory.\n\nOne line in the Declaration points back to this earlier fear: the king had “sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.”⁴ Those officers were not symbolic. They were men with keys to other people’s doors.\n\nNow carry that memory forward.\n\nIn Minneapolis this winter, federal immigration agents broke down the front door of a home with guns drawn, forced a man outside in the snow in his underwear and sandals, and then discovered they had the wrong person. Reuters reported the raid as part of a court fight over limits a lower judge had placed on immigration agents’ use of force and arrests in the city.⁵\n\nA few days later, the city was confronting something worse. On January 7, Renée Nicole Good, a thirty-seven-year-old U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an ICE officer during an operation. The Washington Post later reported details from an independent autopsy commissioned by her family and described the conflict between federal officials and Minnesota authorities over how the killing would be investigated.⁶ The New Yorker described Minneapolis as the center of one of the largest ICE operations in decades, and it described a city adjusting to the presence of federal force the way occupied cities always do: carrying documents, watching corners, staying home.⁷\n\nThen came the line that would have sounded familiar to anyone who has ever lived under a government arguing itself above the law. Vice President JD Vance defended the officer involved by claiming he was protected by “absolute immunity” from state prosecution. A fact-check by Gigafact made the point bluntly: federal officers do not enjoy absolute immunity from state criminal law.⁸ Even setting doctrine aside, the political message was unmistakable. Do what you must. We will argue later about jurisdiction.\n\nAround the same time, a newly disclosed internal ICE memo became public. The Los Angeles Times reported that the memo authorized agents, in certain circumstances, to enter homes without a judge-signed warrant, relying instead on administrative authority. The article described a Minneapolis arrest in which a battering ram was used to break down a door.⁹ Senator Richard Blumenthal wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanding documents and warning that the policy appeared to violate the Fourth Amendment.¹⁰\n\nThis is the moment where constitutional theory stops being abstract.\n\nThe difference between a judicial warrant and an administrative warrant is not academic when someone is hitting your door with a ram. The Fourth Amendment does not promise that the government will never come to your home. It promises that an independent judge will be part of the decision before force meets wood.\n\nWhen enforcement arrives first and judicial review follows later, constitutional process begins to look ornamental. The Fourth Amendment does not fail when warrants disappear. It fails when force comes first and legality is written afterward.\n\nIn 1776, writs of assistance collapsed three protections at once: judges without independence, searches without cause, seizures without limits. In 2026, the danger is not mass warrants. It is selective ones, aimed carefully, defended as law, experienced as warning.\n\nThis is where Sherrill’s grievance list begins to feel less like history and more like a checklist.\n\nWhen an executive can nullify laws after they are passed, legislation becomes optional. When prosecutors can be appointed unlawfully and cases proceed anyway, justice becomes discretionary theater. When judges face political threats for rulings, independence becomes risk management. When armed federal forces are deployed into cities over local objection, force becomes policy. And when investigations follow critics rather than conduct, search becomes discipline.\n\nThe founders were not naïve about their own contradictions, and early enforcement of the Fourth Amendment was uneven and often unjust. But they understood something enduring about how power first enters private life. Tyranny does not begin with a ban. It begins with process, with who may enter, who may take, and who decides when suspicion is enough. That is why the grievance list is not a catalogue of outrages. It is a system diagram.\n\nIn Chicago last year, a city council aide named Elena Martínez stood outside a courthouse after a hearing on federal deployments and told a local reporter she had stopped carrying certain documents in her bag—not because she was doing anything wrong, but because she did not want to have to explain herself to someone who had already decided she was a problem.¹¹\n\nThat is how the Fourth Amendment actually dies. Not with proclamations, but with adjustments that feel prudent in isolation and irreversible in accumulation.\n\nIn Newark, the paper sound returned as Sherrill finished. Pages closed, folders stacked, the room exhaled. Outside on Broad Street, a police cruiser idled with its lights off while a delivery truck rattled over a patched seam in the pavement. Ordinary sounds, the kind you stop noticing, but James Otis would have recognized them at once.\n\nThey were the noise of a state deciding how close it intends to stand.\n\nWhen Americans wrote the Fourth Amendment, they were not trying to perfect liberty. They were trying to make a promise to themselves: that no government, however legal, would again make its first move inside their homes. Two and a half centuries later, the question is not whether that promise has been broken, but how often we are willing to pretend we did not hear the door.\n\n⸻\n\nBiibliography\n\n1\\.
