The second one comes from another left-leaning but business-oriented legacy magazine, _Fortune_.\n\nWhich do you think has 1) been reported more honestly, and 2) has more potential impact on our lives?\n\nThe answers are 1) neither, and 2) obviously, our rapidly exploding and unsustainable public debt. _It’s getting scary_.\n\nBut there’s no doubt, thanks to Trump Derangement Syndrome™, crazies on The Left™ are hyperfocused on yet another White House renovation, not unlike dozens that have occurred before, going back to the James Madison Administration after the war of 1812. The British burned the building in 1814, so renovations were necessary.\n\nMore followed, especially in 1902 when Theodore Roosevelt created the West Wing. Before that, the President’s office was in the White House. The famous Lincoln Bedroom, which the Clinton Administration (and probably a few others) [rented out for campaign cash](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/clinton-white-house-sleepover-guests-still-writing-checks/), was President Lincoln’s office.\n\n[![A BBC annotated satellite image shows the East Wing of the White House alongside the rest of the building and the South Lawn. It highlights a structure at the extreme east where demolition works are being carried out](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SnD2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eb25908-d0e2-4489-aead-b69869ab2e97_480x337.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SnD2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eb25908-d0e2-4489-aead-b69869ab2e97_480x337.webp)\n\nScores of other White House renovations followed. Here are a few:\n\n* In 1817, James Monroe, our fifth President, moved in and built the South Portico.\n\n* In 1829, Andrew Jackson oversaw the building of the North Portico.\n\n* In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt launched an effort to move the President’s offices from the private residences on the second floor to a new West Wing.\n\n* In 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing, which included the construction of the first Oval Office.\n\n* In 1913, First Lady (and some say acting president after Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke during his second term) Ellen Wilson created the Rose Garden.\n\n* From 1934-1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the West Wing in 1934, adding a second floor, basement, swimming pool, and relocating the Oval Office. In 1942, he constructed the East Wing for additional staff and wartime security, including a bomb shelter.\n\n* In 1948, with the White House in decay and disrepair, President Harry Truman began the most extensive renovation in American history, including gutting and rebuilding the interior of the President’s mansion. Truman relocated across the street to Blair House during this period.\n\n* Beginning in 1970, President Richard Nixon added a one-lane bowling alley. Nixon also paved over a swimming pool to create what is today the White House press briefing room.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!k0RJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817314a8-33b6-4e67-bb0e-0cdb7fb03bab_395x506.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!k0RJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817314a8-33b6-4e67-bb0e-0cdb7fb03bab_395x506.jpeg)\n\n* In 2009, President Barack Obama replaced a tennis court with a basketball court.\n\nNow fast forward to 2025. Goofy, unintelligent, and uninformed TDS-afflicted partisans are pearl-clutching over Trump’s admittedly gaudy construction of a new ballroom to replace much of the 1942 East Wing, ~~previously uninteresting and not historically significant~~, occupied by staff for the First Lady. It was also previously proposed for demolition or renovation and is devoid of historical significance beyond its former occupants. It is the least interesting aspect of any White House tour.\n\nWhile I’ve been to plenty of events and press conferences in the White House’s East Room, the largest room in the complex, it can accommodate only about 200 people for state dinners or other official events. That’s paltry compared to what other countries do, especially Great Britain, which can seat that many people around rectangular or U-shaped tables for one of their official state dinners.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yp98!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62241321-92f3-4742-9fbf-bd2f5c80b2b7_1920x1080.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yp98!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62241321-92f3-4742-9fbf-bd2f5c80b2b7_1920x1080.webp)\n\n{{caption:The seating for a state dinner at Buckingham Palace.}}\n\nI support President Trump’s plans to build a ballroom that can better accommodate White House events, especially state dinners.\n\nEspecially if it might enhance my chances of being invited to one.\n\nFuture Presidents, no matter their partisan affiliation, will thank him for it. Trust me on this.\n\nKudos to the President for raising private capital to pay for it. The White House Historical Association has confirmed that they were consulted as part of the process, and [the White House website outlines the procedures they took](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-white-house/) to design and launch the project.\n\nEvery previous President and First Lady was lauded for their changes to the White House, from Jacqueline Kennedy to Hillary Clinton. But since Donald Trump, the first actual commercial real estate developer to occupy the White House, is behind this, the reactions are predictable. **TDS™ is real.**\n\nFuture presidents can alter the interior. There’s no evidence that the exterior is inconsistent with the outward appearances of the White House complex.\n\nPeople need to get over themselves. Maybe focus on how the $38 trillion and growing public debt is really on the verge of changing your lives for the worse, and sooner than you think.",
