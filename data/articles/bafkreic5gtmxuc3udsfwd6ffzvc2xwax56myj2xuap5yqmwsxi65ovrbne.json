  "body": "One of my hobbies is raytracing using POV-Ray for Windows (available at [https://www.povray,org](https://www.povray.org)). After going through several sessions of Dr. Jennifer Weber’s “Reason over Reaction” series, I was inspired to create animated GIF images with the message “Practice the pause”.\n\nI believe that taking time to pause and reflect before responding to social media content is essential to helping us understand one another and represent each other well. It’s also necessary for any meaningful problem-solving activities. But pausing and reflecting are not encouraged when we are online, much less reinforced. I think at some level, many of us would prefer to take more time to pause and reflect, but we don’t think it’s worth the trouble. It’s just easier to react quickly and move on.\n\nSo, to both create a reminder for myself as well as encourage others, I wanted to have an image that communicated in words as well as through other means to stop for just a little bit. To this end, I created images that encourage users to pause in several ways: first, with the larger text, second, with the text on the floor, and third, by animating each image with noticeable delays between frames.\n\nThe four GIF images are the same except for resolution; they all have six frames with a two-second delay between frames. Each image has the words “Practice the pause” in larger text over a floor tiled with smaller images that all read “Practice the pause”. The only colors I used were red, green, and blue.\n\nResolutions are specified in the captions beneath each image. The four resolutions (in pixels) I used were as follows:\n\n* 480x270\n\n* 720x400\n\n* 1280x720\n\n* 1920x1080\n\nFeel free to download these images to your computer or mobile device for your own use.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M2rC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd585316-4d8e-4b50-a2eb-57b157c6d997_480x270.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M2rC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd585316-4d8e-4b50-a2eb-57b157c6d997_480x270.gif)\n\n{{caption:“Practice the pause” - 480x270}}\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mMLC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d6c6f33-327a-4539-bef6-d054abb75e1e_720x400.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mMLC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d6c6f33-327a-4539-bef6-d054abb75e1e_720x400.gif)\n\n{{caption:“Practice the pause” - 720x400}}\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pTJq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65aaaf19-b670-489f-9d14-9b2525a96633_1280x720.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pTJq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65aaaf19-b670-489f-9d14-9b2525a96633_1280x720.gif)\n\n{{caption:“Practice the pause” - 1280x720}}\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IGcp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6880711d-a173-46fa-a799-b0974f84de93_1920x1080.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IGcp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6880711d-a173-46fa-a799-b0974f84de93_1920x1080.gif)\n\n{{caption:“Practice the pause” -1920x1080}}",
