I disliked it so much that I changed the channel (okay, switched streaming apps). I decided I would [read the transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/presidential-address-on-12-17-25) later.\n\nIt reads much better than he delivered it. It contained many of his usual exaggerations, which I’ve learned to expect from real estate developers. It was a little tough and too partisan at times, especially for a speech given during the Holidays, when joy and reconciliation should dominate. But as I read the transcript, he framed the issue of affordability about as well as he could in about 13 of his 18 minutes.\n\n> “Here at home, we’re bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin. The last administration and their allies in Congress looted our treasury for trillions of dollars, driving up prices and everything at levels never seen before. I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast. Let’s look at the facts. Under the Biden administration, car prices rose 22%, and in many states, 30% or more.\n>\n> “Gasoline rose 30 to 50%. Hotel rates rose 37%. Airfares rose 31%. Now under our leadership they’re all coming down, and coming down fast. Democrat politicians also sent the cost of grocery soaring, but we are solving that too. The price of a Thanksgiving Turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year. The price of eggs is down 82% since March, and everything else is falling rapidly, and it’s not done yet. But boy, are we making progress. Nobody can believe what’s going on.”\n>\n> _[President Donald Trump](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/presidential-address-on-12-17-25)_\n\nIt started off as just another campaign speech. It wasn’t until at least 5 minutes in that he began to finally discuss affordability and the economy.\n\nFrom the start, it was unwatchable and ineffective, and transcript aside, will be forgotten in a few days.\n\nI don’t remember Ronald Reagan ever yelling at me. He never even lectured me (a Barack Obama specialty).\n\n“I have seen Donald Trump give good speeches,” wrote radio talker Erick Erickson. “I have seen Donald Trump give great speeches. That speech was not great. It was eighteen minutes of the President yelling that life is good and you should be grateful.”\n\nOh, I know, “the base,” as we call it, loved it. They can never get enough of Donald Trump, and he’s never wrong. And they can be just as delusional as those on the left who reflexively recoil in horror and opposition every time Donald Trump does . . . _anything_. Take the Venezuelan drug-running boats, for example. Democrats didn’t complain when President George H. W. Bush sent troops to invade Panama and capture Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega with no authorization from Congress. Bush notified congressional leaders moments before the December 20, 1989, invasion. Noriega was shuttled to Miami, where he was tried and convicted for drug smuggling.\n\nBut now, Trump is engaged in an “act of war,” one Democratic wag in Congress complained.\n\n[![\\<b>Howard Air Force, Panama:\\</b> On January 3, 1990 General Noriega surrended to US forces and was turned over to the DEA before boarding a US military plane to face drug charges in Miami.

He’s mostly right about the “affordability” issue that he and the GOP ignored or ineffectively addressed during last month’s off-year election in Virginia and elsewhere. As his website notes, he deserves credit for policies that have helped dramatically reduce fuel prices, the benefits of which will take time to be felt in other than gasoline fill-ups. And volatile natural gas prices, which fuels a large proportion of utility and manufacturing plants, is slightly higher (almost $1 per gallon) than it was when Trump took office.\n\nLower prices for fuel and fertilizer inputs may take _an entire growing_ _season_ in 2026 to be felt. Will Trump will follow up his reduction or elimination of tariffs on some staples, like coffee and cocoa, for other commodities (like tin plate steel used to make food and beverage cans)? [The Supreme Court may have a say on the issue](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-6de9d1a477ddd59b995e8b87edf86372).\n\nAs military historian, author, and pundit Victor Davis Hanson noted [yesterday](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/12/16/its-the-economy-stupid-how-a-political-meme-toppled-a-president-and-could-do-it-again/?utm_source=TDS_Email\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_campaign=exclusive-cbp-busts-meth-breakfast-cereal-smuggling-attempt) in a post for the Heritage Foundation’s _Daily Signal_, it is reminiscent of the economic stagnation that sent Bush 41’s approval ratings plummeting from a record-high 90 percent after the US success over Iraq in Operation Desert Storm, a year after Noriega’s capture. I was a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Transportation during that time, so I remember it well.\n\n> Because—I hope this doesn’t sound eerily similar to the problem today—but they said: We had such foreign policy successes. We were polling 90%. They said: The recession is almost over. Look at all the GDP, the inflation. They’re all going in the right direction, and they’re not at recessionary levels.\n>\n> Meanwhile, the Clinton-Gore-George Stephanopoulos team was saying, “It’s the economy, stupid.” And they took that meme and said: This is the worst economy since the Great Depression. We have no jobs. [Inflation](https://www.dailysignal.com/tag/inflation) is affordable. And then they got an amplification from Ross Perot. He was kind of like the never Trumpers of that age, although he was an independent third party.\n>\n> _Victor Davis Hanson, The Daily Signal_\n\nTeam Bush, sans the legendary Lee Atwater, who had died from brain cancer after being the mastermind behind Bush’s 1988 election win over Gov. Michael Dukakis (D-MA), reacted too late and too meekly to perceptions about the economy, which Gov. and future President Bill Clinton (R-AR) exploited with a massive assist from Independent Ross Perot. Clinton would win only 43% of the popular vote, but that outpaced Bush’s 37% and Perot’s 19%, one of the highest totals in history by a third-party or independent candidate for President (he won no Electoral College votes, however).\n\nIt didn’t help that Bush violated his “read my lips; no new taxes” pledge from the 1988 campaign. The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990, which Bush signed, raised income, payroll, and excise taxes on millions of Americans. He would later express regret, but the damage was done.\n\nMalevolents in the media used Bush’s ill-fated visit to a grocers convention, where he marveled at barcode scanners, to underscore his detachment from the “kitchen table” economic challenges faced by many voters. It was [unfairly reported](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/12/04/ap-was-there-bushs-bum-rap-on-amazing-barcode-scanner/), but no matter. Former Gov. and US Senator Mitt Romney had [a similar experience](https://youtu.be/Kgi1t_j5_Bs?si=ienzUPk4WJnSChZG) in 2012.\n\nTrump shouldn’t risk a visit to a grocery store.\n\n{{youtube:akLjzTisZoI}}\n\nI remember my then-boss, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, standing, grinning, and applauding in the House Chamber during Bush’s 1991 State of the Union Address when he made transportation and infrastructure the linchpin of his economic strategy, following a short, mild recession that was pretty much nearly over (Skinner would later take over as White House Chief of Staff during the Bush Administration’s final months).\n\nThat was also the last time we hiked the federal gasoline tax by a nickel (it remains at roughly 19 cents per gallon - most state gasoline taxes are _much higher_). As Barack Obama would learn early in his presidency, the economic and political benefits of “shovel-ready” infrastructure investments take a long time to ripple through the economy. And never mind that the legislation in which Bush broke his pledge helped set the stage for balanced budgets and economic success during the Clinton presidency, not unlike the Carter Administration’s transportation deregulation efforts in 1980 set the stage for much of the Reagan Administration’s economic success.\n\nHas the Trump presidency learned from history?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UclP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda214d7e-c8a2-4154-bd60-52a0ca0a4b56_1383x702.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UclP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda214d7e-c8a2-4154-bd60-52a0ca0a4b56_1383x702.jpeg)\n\nThe answer is yes, and the White House’s [website](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/democrats-caused-high-prices-president-trump-is-bringing-them-down/) on “affordability” is excellent. With the mid-term congressional elections and control of Congress at stake, the White House’s sense of urgency is justified. But last night’s frenetic and fiery speech, just before Christmas, won’t help very much. There was a better way to correct misconceptions about the cause and solution to the economic pain consumers continue to feel from Democratic policies of the past four years, which resulted in the highest inflation in 40 years.\n\nIt is no doubt head shaking, if not mind blowing, that many swing voters are turning to the very party that caused much of the pain they’re experiencing, out of frustration with lower fuel prices and job and income growth yet to be felt by “ordinary” Americans. But yelling at voters with partisan pitches from the White House is not going to change perceptions. With a focus on tariffs, which have no doubt added pricing pressure to many staples, from artificial Christmas trees to canned food, Trump has not successfully persuaded us that tariffs are the magic bullet that he claims. That, despite the generous $1,776 checks he is sending to active duty military personnel and a few reserve components, in the form of “base housing allowance” (BHA) payments. Most Americans, me included, believe tariffs are taxes, and they’re being passed on to consumers.\n\nBusiness don’t pay taxes. They pass them along as a cost of doing business. _That’s Econ 101_. I won’t get into the tariff issue here, and no doubt there are benefits from increased investment in American manufacturing (“on-shoring” and “re-shoring”), but the price tags on items in the grocery store, nor rising electricity costs and health and car insurance bills don’t lie.\n\nI was surprised in large part by the President’s staging. The Christmas look was fine, and standing behind a podium with a distracting microphone may look presidential, but it didn’t play to Trump’s strengths, nor did it meet the moment.\n\n## **“A standard campaign speech, delivered loudly and quickly” -** **[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5654408-trump-year-one-address/)**\n\nYou don’t inform and assure people by yelling at them. Trump, when he’s in conversation mode, can be quite charming. I’ve seen it. He would have been more effective sitting behind the Resolute desk and, in a conversational tone, walked through his acknowledgement about how Americans feel; a clinical and less-partisan diagnosis of the problem; his actions and accomplishments thus far _on the economy_; and outlining additional steps needed (e.g., health insurance reform).\n\nVice President JD Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have better messaging on this than Trump. “Trump knows one thing: he speaks to the base well. JD Vance can actually stick to the subject and the prepared arguments. That’s impossible for Trump,” said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, told _Reuters_.\n\n> “Even though we’ve made incredible progress, we understand that there’s a lot more work to do, and the thing that I’d ask from the American people is a little bit of patience,” Vance said. “I promise you, there is no person more impatient to solve the affordability crisis than Donald J. Trump.”\n>\n> Later, Vance visited Allentown Rescue Mission, a Christian homeless shelter and rehabilitation center for men, where he donned a hairnet and dished up plates of turkey and ham alongside his wife, Usha.\n>\n> Vice President JD Vance, as reported by _[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jd-vance-tours-pennsylvania-make-economic-case-amid-inflation-concerns-2025-12-16/)_\n\n> “I am very confident about 2026,” Bessent said. “So under the one, big, beautiful bill especially for working Americans, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, auto deductibility on loans for American cars, that’s all kicking in. Americans have not changed their withholding so they’re going to see substantial refunds to working families in the first quarter of 2026.”\n>\n> “I am very, very optimistic in 2026. We are setting the table for a very strong, non-inflationary growth economy,” Bessent added.\n>\n> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC’s _Meet the Press_, as reported by the _[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/3896253/bessent-optimistic-economy-not-enter-recession/)_\n\nTrump should dispatch himself and his Cabinet around the country early next year with “listening sessions” with workers, tours of manufacturing facilities, story telling, and a laser-like focus on [getting the GOP behind a health insurance reform bill](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/go-ahead-gop-take-on-the-health-care) empowers consumers and uses market competition and transparency to reduce costs. Pressuring some manufacturers, such as the meat-packing and medical industries, through jawboning or anti-trust action is welcome. Voters need to see and understand that the President and the GOP are on their side.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E46v!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44774ffc-b801-458e-a0b8-f865349000ac_4000x2250.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E46v!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44774ffc-b801-458e-a0b8-f865349000ac_4000x2250.jpeg)\n\nSpeeches are best made by show-and-tell outside of Washington. And it’s going to take time and repetition for it all to resonate. Patience and discipline, neither hallmarks of a Trump presidency, will be required.\n\nTrump also cannot count on the legacy media to tell his side of the story. Just the opposite, and they will misreport and exaggerate more than he does. He and his administration need to broaden their media outreach to middle-of-the-road media and conservative-leaning outlets, including media outside the infamous Acela corridor (Boston-NY-DC).\n\nStories from real American farmers and workers on how the prices they pay are coming down will help, and it will take sophistication, repetition, and a lot of work to get them told. And speaking of Ronald Reagan, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for Donald Trump to initiate well-scripted weekend radio messages, short two-minute addresses that amplify these stories and help tell the Administration’s side of the story, the kind Reagan used to do with regularity and effectiveness.\n\nAs we saw at the Kennedy Center honors, Trump is a terrific master of ceremonies. He could even use weekly radio addresses to personally interview examples of “success stories” from his policies, even his tariffs.\n\nHistory suggests that 2026 will not be kind to the party in power - the GOP. And persuading Americans that they’re better off than they were two or four years ago will not be easy, nor quick. Blame-gaming and partisan attacks alone are never effective, and bore most Americans. Last night’s speech didn’t help, nor do one-off distractions such as Trump’s disgusting reaction to the tragic murder of Hollywood actor and director Rob Reiner and his wife. But a good follow up plan, both with concrete actions and results, will eventually reap benefits. Time will tell if that, along with some long-missing discipline, will be enough.\n\n> “For so long as before my election, the vast majority of good and decent Americans were forced to watch as corrupt politician plundered the halls of power, exploited our taxpayers, and pillaged every system that makes civilized society function, but not anymore. And you see that every day, not anymore. We’re putting America first and we are making America great again. Very simple. We are making America great again. Tonight, after 11 months, our border is secure, inflation is stopped, wages are up, prices are down, our nation is strong. America is respected, and our country is back stronger than ever before.\n>\n> “We’re poised for an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen. Soon we will host the World Cup and the Olympics, both of which I got, but most importantly, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. There could be no more fitting tribute to this epic milestone than to complete the comeback of America that began just one year ago. When the world looks at us next year, let them see a nation that is loyal to its citizens, faithful to its workers, confident to its identity, certain to its destiny, and the envy of the entire globe. We are respected again like we have never been respected before. To each and every one of you, have a Merry Christmas and a happy new year. God bless you all.”\n>\n> _President Donald Trump_",
