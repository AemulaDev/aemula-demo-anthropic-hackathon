Linda Kilfoil stood in her Fort Lauderdale kitchen watching it pool around her feet. Her husband Peter tried not to slip as he fetched towels. She remembers him cracking a joke about “resilience”—about how the state wouldn’t stop using that word as $40,000 worth of drywall, cabinetry, and wiring warped and buckled around them.\n\nThey had done what homeowners are told to do. They filed a claim with Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, Florida’s state-run insurer of last resort. They waited. Then they got the denial.\n\n“Long-term leakage,” they were told. Not covered. Even though the pipe had burst like a firecracker just three days after a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nThey sued. Or tried to. But their case never reached a courtroom. Instead, it was diverted into a narrow hallway of bureaucracy known as the Division of Administrative Hearings—DOAH for short—where there’s no jury, no discovery, and no chance to cross-examine the adjuster who denied your claim. Just a state-employed judge, a fast-tracked process, and a settlement offer so low it might as well have been a dare.\n\nThey took it. Peter was already battling two types of cancer. He didn’t have the strength for another drawn-out fight.\n\nThe final payout? Five hundred dollars.\n\nSix months later, Peter died.\n\nThe smell of mildew fades from the tile. But in Florida, a deeper rot is setting in.\n\nOver the last three years, Florida’s home insurance crisis has pushed more than 1.4 million policyholders into Citizens after private insurers either fled the state or collapsed under the weight of back-to-back billion-dollar storms¹. As disasters doubled, then doubled again—four in 2022, eight in 2023, eleven in 2024—state lawmakers moved fast. They passed legislation that rerouted disputed claims into DOAH, framing the shift as a matter of “administrative efficiency.” What it eliminated, in practice, was the right to a jury trial.\n\n“This goes against the foundation of our justice system,” said then–State Representative Hillary Cassel, a former insurance lawyer who understood exactly what it meant for Citizens to handpick the judges². She understood the stakes.\n\nShe also knew the math. In circuit court, Citizens wins just 55% of the time. But at DOAH? Over 90%³.\n\n**Here’s how DOAH works—and why critics say it’s rigged**: Homeowners who challenge a denial are automatically rerouted into an administrative system where standard courtroom procedures vanish. Most never see a ruling. According to a 2025 ProPublica and _Sun Sentinel_ investigation, 78% of DOAH cases settle early—and half of those end in payouts of $500 or less⁴. Like the Kilfoils. Like dozens of other families whose names don’t appear in legal records, just in contractor invoices and hospice logs.\n\nJeffery McShane is one of them. A retired school custodian in Central Florida, his HVAC system was ravaged by mold after a burst pipe. Repairs totaled over $200,000. Citizens denied the claim, citing exclusions buried in the fine print. Fighting it could’ve meant walking away with nothing. Settling got him five grand.\n\n“It’s not justice,” he told the _Sun Sentinel_. “It’s attrition. They’re counting on you to wear out before they do.”⁵\n\nThat wear is visible now—not just in warped baseboards and sagging ceilings, but in the way neighbors stop telling their stories. They’ve learned not to expect anyone to listen.\n\nBut one man did fight back.\n\nAfter Hurricane Milton tore up his roof, Tampa homeowner Martin Alvarez filed a claim. When Citizens lowballed the payout and forced him into DOAH, he sued back. He filed for an injunction. And in August, for the first time, a judge listened.\n\nHillsborough County Circuit Judge Melissa Polo sided with Alvarez, pausing all DOAH redirections statewide⁶. Her ruling called the system “structurally biased.” She cited restrictions on evidence, lack of public oversight, and a recurring pattern in which legal fees were awarded to Citizens—even when homeowners had withdrawn their claims. She didn’t use the word “rigged.” She didn’t need to.\n\nStill, Citizens isn’t backing down. At an October board meeting, CEO Tim Cerio waved off Polo’s decision as theater. “Trial attorneys are gaming the system,” he said. “The process is fast, fair, and efficient.”⁷\n\nEfficient, yes. Especially if your metric is reducing the state’s financial exposure.\n\nSince peaking in 2023, Citizens has slashed its policy count by 63%, with projections to drop below 500,000 by year’s end. Sixteen new private insurers have re-entered the market, lured by the state’s friendlier legal climate. On paper, it looks like a policy win.\n\nUnless you’re Peter Kilfoil. Unless you’re Linda, waking up alone to black mold under the drywall. Unless “resilience” means learning to take the five hundred bucks and die before the paperwork clears.\n\nCassel, now out of office, still gets calls. “People think they’re going to court,” she said. “They don’t realize they’ve been walked into arbitration disguised as justice.”⁸\n\nAlvarez does realize it. And this fall, as tile mildew crept back through his hallway from another burst pipe, he filed a second claim. This time, he told his lawyer, they’re not settling. He wants a jury. He wants to look someone in the eye. He wants a room that doesn’t smell like surrender.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\. Allaire Conte, _Citizens Insurance Wins 90% of Disputes.
