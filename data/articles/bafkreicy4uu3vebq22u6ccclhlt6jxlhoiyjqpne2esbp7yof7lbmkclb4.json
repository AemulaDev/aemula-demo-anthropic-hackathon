The month before that, a longtime Republican acquaintance’s family had their fence graffitied with the word “NAZI,” presumably because of the Trump sign that has hung in their yard since the first Trump administration.\n\nAn acquaintance told me, “The world would be so much more peaceful without religion.” When I pushed back, pointing out that atheism hasn’t stopped China from committing genocide and putting people in internment camps, the person I was talking with replied, “I mean, the Uyghurs wouldn’t give up their religion, so…”\n\nJust a few weeks ago, a guy sitting next to me at the winery calmly told me, “Yeah, I support the Houthis’ goals,” over a wine tasting and accused me of having been brainwashed against them by family in the military.\n\nThe left-wing authoritarians that surround us\\[2] don’t see themselves as tyrannical monsters. They see themselves as the good guys, the heroes “defending democracy” (see the WWU video) and, as many people told me during COVID, about mandatory masking, vaccination, and school shutdowns, “saving lives!” They believe in loving their neighbors, caring for the least of these, and equal rights. Allowing men in women’s sports isn’t recognized as the destruction of women’s human rights, it’s celebrated as the advancement of civil rights for trans people. Cross sex hormones and sex reassignment surgery for kids aren’t seen as destroying kids’ futures; they’re perceived as saving them.\n\nEven among local Republicans, I have been told:\n\n* “Constitutional rights don’t apply to non-citizens.”\n\n* “_If_ it’s true that we’ve deported people without the required process to an El Salvadoran prison, it doesn’t really matter to me. What matters to me is my family and my friends, and they’re not going to be deported.”\n\n* “The Constitution is not a suicide pact. We cannot deport 20 million people and give people individualized hearings.”\n\n* “People who come here illegally **should** fear being imprisoned for the rest of their lives.”\n\n* “I don’t care if a bunch of foreigners get deported. We need to prioritize heritage Americans. I don’t care if they’re here legally or not.”\n\n* At the WAGOP state convention last year, an angry person near me in the convention hall yelled, “String him up!” about the chair, Jim Walsh, in response to his announcement that gubernatorial primary candidate Semi Bird had failed the Party’s background check.\n\n* I can’t count how many times I’ve been called a “RINO” (Republican in Name Only) or “establishment.” I’ve been called a “cuckservative” (someone with a cuckold fetish for watching America get f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*) a few times.\n\nOnline, I’ve been told multiple times some variation of, “We’ll send you to El Salvador next!” for the crimes of opposing tariffs, opposing Jan. 6th, and supporting due process for everyone.\n\nThe right-wing authoritarians that surround us\\[3] don’t see themselves as tyrannical monsters. They see themselves as the good guys, the heroes rebuilding Christendom, taking back power from woke mobs and corrupt leaders to restore order, and as a culture that celebrates the Enlightenment values that made America great, and punishes immoral authoritarian elites who are destroying the country. Mass deportation of illegal aliens isn’t recognized as xenophobia against foreigners; it’s seen as restoring civil order and protecting their neighbors from violent crime, overburdened services, and dangerous, uninsured drivers. They see themselves as loving their family, local community, and America. Restoring a high cultural value for Christianity isn’t inhibiting religious freedom; they conceive of it as creating a stronger, healthier, and more decent America.\n\nRachel Kleinfeld, Senior Fellow of the Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace cites Nathan Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason’s book, “**Radical American Partisanship”** for a statistic compiled from 2017 CCES Partisan Hostility Items, showing that since 2017, Republicans and Democrats have shared roughly equal low-level support for political violence, with occasional spikes related to specific incidents. By 2021, we were at a similar level of acceptance for political violence as the Catholics and Protestants were in Ireland amid The Troubles.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Ijc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1912a17d-3a07-4f3c-b51b-2b76287f811a_1170x1246.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Ijc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1912a17d-3a07-4f3c-b51b-2b76287f811a_1170x1246.png)\n\nHow did we get here?\n\n_**The road to hell is paved with good intentions.**_\n\nAlmost all Americans (74%) agree: “Donald Trump should follow the Constitution, even if it means he sometimes can’t get things done.\"\\[4]\n\nHowever, there’s a clear conflict within this claim. Polling consistently finds that around 60% of Republicans prefer an executive who “sticks to their principles, no matter what.\"\\[5,6] If the executive’s principles are the US Constitution, that’s an excellent thing! However, if the executive’s principles abuse or undermine the Constitution or the rule of law, that creates cognitive dissonance. When the Constitution and an executive’s principles are mutually exclusive, which wins?\n\nThe Republican voters who openly support Trump abandoning the Constitution to get things done are mostly Gen Z’ers, but there are far more Republicans who agree that politicians shouldn’t compromise, even if they don’t get everything they wanted or promised.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-HqL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c200e6f-f094-4867-ad7c-4be4ee6c34b1_1504x964.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-HqL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c200e6f-f094-4867-ad7c-4be4ee6c34b1_1504x964.png)\n\nThere is still a shared value here! Everyone agrees that the government isn’t working well. At the end of March, Congress’s highest approval rating came from Republican-leaning voters, only 40% of whom approved of the job Congress was doing. That was stratospherically high compared to Independents’ and Democrats’ approval of Congress, which barely cracked double digits.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLSb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ce6e94-6dd0-47e6-b7b4-43ddacab5e64_1302x86.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLSb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ce6e94-6dd0-47e6-b7b4-43ddacab5e64_1302x86.png)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-zb3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6dae3db-e781-435b-ae9e-0005347f5509_2168x414.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-zb3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6dae3db-e781-435b-ae9e-0005347f5509_2168x414.png)\n\n**Everyone wants the federal government to do something, but there is stark disagreement about what it should do, how it should do it, which of their goals is Constitutionally permissible, and whether that even matters.**\n\nDemocrats are more likely to say they support compromise in politics, but this can come at the expense of Constitutional institutions.\\[7] While Republican support for the Electoral College (an enumerated Constitutional practice!) is split, Democrats overwhelmingly support its elimination, replacing it with an unconstitutional popular majority vote.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HEoV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedc5f0d-6ed6-4019-86e4-0b5ea5e3e5a3_852x980.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HEoV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbedc5f0d-6ed6-4019-86e4-0b5ea5e3e5a3_852x980.png)\n\nLikewise, when it comes to the 2nd Amendment, an enumerated Constitutional right, Democrats overwhelmingly favor minimizing it.\\[8]\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uvFc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe26aa613-cc08-4e03-b75e-fbbb06c42673_1308x898.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uvFc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe26aa613-cc08-4e03-b75e-fbbb06c42673_1308x898.png)\n\nIn recent years, Democrats have clamored to “reform” the Supreme Court when it makes a decision they believe is wrong but in this moment of populist authoritarianism, only 56% of Republicans and 27% of Democrats approve of its decisions.

More Americans confused the 2nd Amendment with the 1st than recalled our right to petition the government!\n\n[![Figure depicting respondents' knowledge of first amendment protections from the APPC Constitution Day Survey.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DDKv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe157201b-0d6e-41da-9110-951ca2035b21_500x313.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DDKv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe157201b-0d6e-41da-9110-951ca2035b21_500x313.png)\n\nOnly 56% of Americans correctly identified the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of whether a law is Constitutional.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gLSc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65ca8119-f263-44ec-ba7f-07cd73616327_960x306.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gLSc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65ca8119-f263-44ec-ba7f-07cd73616327_960x306.png)\n\n48% of Republicans supported allowing the American public to vote to overturn controversial Supreme Court decisions. Guys! This is _literally why the Constitutional Amendment process exists!_\n\nIn last year’s American Bar Association survey, only 37% of Americans identified us— the people— as primarily responsible for safeguarding our democracy.\\[10] Speaking of that word, “democracy,” let’s talk about how it’s used.\n\nEarlier, I quoted a professor, Nathan Kalmoe, from the University of Wisconsin, on support for political violence. While he claims to abhor political violence, he advocates “subverting” the US Constitution, the US Senate, the US Supreme Court, and even the states themselves (begin at 1:04:07).\n\n“I think we have a number of undemocratic institutions, including the Constitution, and those need to be democratized.”\n\n“I think we should subvert undemocratic institutions and improve them or replace those \\[sic] with democratic institutions.”\n\n**People can express shared values (e.g., love of country, free speech, care for community, and civic education) and ends (free and fair elections, equality for all, better outcomes), engage respectfully, and still support means that you believe to be distinctly evil.**\n\nWhether it’s a Political Science scholar on political violence, [Steve Bannon](https://youtu.be/hsGaj6WFrX0?si=IwRzC9Fz_3n6YXqj), [Adrian Vermule](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/common-good-constitutionalism/609037/), [Taylor Lorenz](https://youtu.be/Oi7jkOYKlow?si=Xy5fNVQewv9TCHmA), or the general public expressing support for subverting the Constitution for common sense or the common good, patriotic Americans everywhere should resist the siren call of authoritarianism toward their neighbor, the immigrant, and the criminal. Sometimes the monster isn’t other people… sometimes, the monster is us.\n\n“If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”\n\n― Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n\n***\n\n[1] “4/7/25 - NCRI Assassination Culture Brief - Network Contagion Research Institute.” _Network Contagion Research Institute_, 7 Apr. 2025, networkcontagion.us/reports/4-7-25-ncri-assassination-culture-brief/.\n\n[2] Conway, Luke. “The Left Has an Authoritarian Problem (but Doesn’t Know It).” _Presser Mag_, Presser Mag, Sept. 2024, [www.pressermag.com/september-2024/the-left-has-an-authoritarian-problem](http://www.pressermag.com/september-2024/the-left-has-an-authoritarian-problem).
