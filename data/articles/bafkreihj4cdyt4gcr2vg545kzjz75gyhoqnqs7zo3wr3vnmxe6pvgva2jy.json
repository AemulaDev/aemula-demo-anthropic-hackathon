How do we get people to change their minds? Do we use force or the threat of force? Do we try to shame people into changing their minds? Do we try to use logic and reason?\n\nHave we considered the role of letting the other person have their say as a part of persuasion? Is it possible that by asking them questions, we might get them to consider possibilities that were previously not considered?\n\nIs it possible that our own minds might be changed in the process, that we are the ones persuaded to budge on an issue that we consider important? Is that a risk worth taking?\n\nI think that persuasion is best whenever possible. We should all be willing to listen to each other and use logic and reason to justify our views as much as we can. There are no guarantees of success, but persuasion is the preferred practice in most situations where people don’t see eye to eye.\n\nIf I’m wrong about this…change my mind.",
