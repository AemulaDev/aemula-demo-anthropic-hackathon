  "body": "I promised in an earlier piece to talk about why “left” and “right” are inaccurate terms to use when describing the political spectrum in the US. To do so, I will start by explaining the basis for the “left/right” description, explain how it falls short of our current political spectrum, and some scales that I think are more accurate and thus useful frames for political identity, including the notion that most people don’t have coherent frames.\n\nThough the tradition of “Left” and “Right” originated during the French Revolution, when supporters of the monarchy were on the right and supporters of the Revolution were on the left, left and right has, in modernity, been a measure of how much government intervention voters prefer in the economy, with fascism on the far right and anarchy on the far left. This hasn’t been sufficient for as long as I’ve been in politics.\n\n**Republicans and Democrats Both Support Government Intervention in the Market**\nWhen I first became politically aware (circa 2009), the American political right preferred less government intervention in economics and greater political intervention in morality, while the left preferred greater government intervention in the economy and less government intervention in morality. This was most obvious in the Republican party as related to abortion and gay marriage. The primary split in the Party then was between moderate and conservative Republicans, who were defined exclusively by their position on social issues. Conservative Republicans were anti-gay-marriage and pro-life and Moderate Republicans were pro-gay-marriage and pro-choice. Essentially all Republicans were united on the merits of the free market and laissez-faire economics.\n\nAs ineffective as the left/right spectrum was in 2008 when most voters just supported government intervention in different areas of life, it’s even worse now. Today, most working-class Democrats, who support high levels of government intervention in the economy, self-identify as Republicans. They don’t just favor high levels of economic intervention; they’d also like government intervention to preserve what they see as the positive traditions that have anchored their lives. Simultaneously, some of the previously conservative economic wonks now self-identify as moderate Democrats or politically homeless as Donald Trump and displaced Democrats turn the Republican Party into one more favorable toward big government than it has been for nearly a hundred years.\n\nDemocrats, increasingly the party of the college-educated, now experience a similar dilemma. Extremely anti-Trump Republicans, especially in very Red areas, now find themselves pressing economically moderate Democratic candidates to be more supportive of free speech, working with old-school liberals (think Bill Maher) who are horrified by the Progressive Left faction within their party.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Beh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab090bb4-25c4-459a-a267-648568fc9961_1154x1116.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Beh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab090bb4-25c4-459a-a267-648568fc9961_1154x1116.png)\n\nWhat hasn’t changed is that both parties still contain interventionist and isolationist factions, which brings me to one of the options I believe presents a more accurate political frame for people with consistent ideological commitments: [The Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/test). The Political Compass uses a survey to place people on a square with two axes: Economic and Social. It further divides people into quadrants: Authoritarian Left, Libertarian Left, Authoritarian Right, and Libertarian Right. See below for the example from their website.\n\nThis framing recognizes that the way people feel about government intervention often varies based on whether they perceive the government as interfering with their lives or the economy. The Political Compass, for example, is able to consider a person who favors a strong social safety net (authoritarian left on the economic scale, state-imposed collectivism) and the decriminalization of drugs (Libertarian Left or Right on the social scale). On The Political Compass, I fall in the top center of the Libertarian Right quadrant. The Political Compass is better, in my opinion than just a left-right scale. However, it has no way to account for people who share certain policy commitments that are of the Authoritarian Right and of the Libertarian Left. It’s not a perfect system.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sdv2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff75d44db-dc87-49e0-94f7-a19eee99cfa2_1200x767.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sdv2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff75d44db-dc87-49e0-94f7-a19eee99cfa2_1200x767.png)\n\nAnother political map is called the Horseshoe Theory. Horseshoe theory claims that rather than a line or a compass, political ideology is actually more like a horseshoe, with people at both ends being more alike than they are different. I really like horseshoe theory. My favorite example of horseshoe theory is crunchy conservative homeschool moms and crunchy hippy liberal moms. If you live anywhere near me in Washington, you’ve probably encountered both of these archetypes in person. There is very little difference between them. Especially since COVID, they might both homeschool, they’re both probably financially comfortable, likely to be generally anti-vaccine, to oppose genetically modified foods, to have chickens, live on acreage, and place a high value on personal liberty and caring for the environment. Crunchy liberal mom is slightly less likely to own a gun and is more likely to support abortion and be spiritual but not religious. In many ways, they’re difficult to separate, yet they identify with and vote for different parties. Another excellent example is moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats, who often change sides as parties change over time. While they often agree on topics like education, foreign policy, free speech, and broadly on appreciation for capitalism, they disagree on topics like guns and organized Labor. Another classic example is fascism and socialism, which though they appear on opposite ends of a traditional political line graph, I’d argue are more similar than different. Both end in totalitarian governments that micromanage the actions of their people, just for different reasons.\n\nOver time though, my thinking about all types of theoretical framing has shifted. I now believe that Jonathan Haidt is right when he writes in **The Righteous Mind** that most people have moral intuitions that guide their decision-making and most reasoning is actually just rationalization after the fact. Most Americans, I’ve observed, do not have a coherent philosophy that underpins the way they live or the things they say they believe. Instead, most people have some set of core values– [moral foundations](https://moralfoundations.org/) as Jonathan Haidt calls them– from which they intuit everything else. This is why we sometimes feel very strongly about things without being able to identify _why_ we feel so strongly about them.\n\nFor those people (most Americans), the best way to understand what they think and why is the way we do it in Braver Angels– ask them directly about the things they value and the things that concern them and believe what they tell you. I believe the most consistent thing about us as people is that we are extremely inconsistent. Through genuine curiosity, you can better understand what motivates the people who disagree with you.",
