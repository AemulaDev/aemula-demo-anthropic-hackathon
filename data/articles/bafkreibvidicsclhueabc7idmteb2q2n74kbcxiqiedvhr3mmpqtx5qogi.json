It knifes across 25th Avenue, lifting cardboard placards that say “No Kings, No Camps,” and scuttling empty water bottles toward the ICE gate. The fence still smells faintly of pepper spray, even a week after the last dispersal. Someone’s chalked the word “Rebellion?” in pink near the curb. The “free-speech” zone, demarcated by city barricades and a federal injunction, is just wide enough for a brass band and a priest.\n\nMayor Katrina Thompson stands beside a generator-powered floodlight, coat zipped to the chin. “We didn’t choose to have this facility in our community,” she says again, voice even. “But it’s here. And so are Broadview residents.” The cameras catch the quote. They don’t catch the scent—tear gas lingering in the seams of the pavement—or the moment a state trooper wipes pepper foam off his own visor. This time, the agents stayed back.\n\n“A protest does not become a rebellion—merely because of sporadic and isolated incidents of unlawful activity.”¹ The Seventh Circuit’s opinion arrived with surgical understatement, parsing 10 U.S.C. § 12406 (the statute that governs when the President can federalize state National Guard troops in rebellion or crisis) like a blueprint for what didn’t happen. Protesters didn’t breach federal buildings. Police weren’t overwhelmed. The court described crowds “never exceeding 200,” a single spike to 300. The most violent night? Sept. 26, when federal agents deployed gas and pepper balls against a line of clergy and neighbors, then claimed the protests showed “extraordinary risk.” The court disagreed.\n\n“Political opposition is not rebellion.” That line—quiet, clinical—became the week’s refrain.\n\nInside the sealed court filings, affidavits from Broadview Police documented quick containment. DHS officials admitted they didn’t need to intervene the following week. ICE’s own logs showed record removals during the protests, hardly the picture of a system paralyzed by unrest. Mid-October saw local officers return to regular rotation—no Guard, no joint command.\n\nYet the White House wasn’t retreating. Its emergency petition to the Supreme Court claimed the Seventh Circuit “overstepped its judicial role.” It was “denying the Commander-in-Chief his core powers.”² Solicitor General D. John Sauer warned of “irreparable harm.” The administration was no longer merely justifying federalization of the Illinois Guard—it was demanding deployment. That legal difference, once hair-thin, now governs whether troops can stand post on U.S. city streets.\n\nIn Oregon, the air is wetter but no less tense. A week after _Broadview_’s ruling, a Ninth Circuit motions panel stayed Judge Karin Immergut’s initial TRO against federalization. The panel said the President is likely to prevail on § 12406(3)—the clause about being “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws.”³ But deployment itself remains blocked by a second TRO Immergut issued October 5. It’s still in force while the Department of Justice moves to dissolve it. That distinction—between federalizing forces on paper and actually unleashing them on city streets—is what now decides whether a helicopter lands in Portland or stays grounded.\n\nBy then, the city had learned to live with the sound. Low rotor wash. An almost constant hum. In the rainy dark, it sounded like the law arriving before it had been written.\n\nPortland didn’t resemble a war zone. PPB’s crowd logs from late September show “twenty or fewer” protesters most nights. A city councilor—an Army veteran—called the helicopters that flew low over her district “terrorizing.” A resident named Zimmerman, himself a Guard member, told OPB: “It’s an intimidation tactic against American citizens. A bullying tactic to create fake news and disruption in a residential neighborhood.”⁴\n\n“When federal officers—unaided by any military forces—were capable, § 12406(3) is not met.”³\n\nAs Oregon’s injunction held, Illinois braced for its own next move. Back in Chicago, CPD Superintendent Larry Snelling held a press conference after 29 officers reported chemical exposure—from federal agents’ pepper deployments. Snelling stressed that his department “never stood down.” Then, without irony, he added: “This is still our city.”⁵\n\nThat declaration echoed down Michigan Avenue during the “No Kings” march, where Laura, 52, a teacher from Cicero, held a sign reading “I grew up believing in rules” and told WTTW: “Now I’m not sure what’s legal anymore.” Behind her, a woman in a wheelchair rolled past the Art Institute. Her scarf was soaked in vinegar—to break tear gas if it came.\n\n“Chicago is still our city.” — Superintendent Snelling⁵\n\nThe court orders in both regions rest on a shared fulcrum: § 12406 isn’t a blank check. To invoke it, the President must show a state is in rebellion, invaded, or that federal laws cannot be enforced without military aid. In Illinois, the evidence pointed the other way—federal laws were being enforced, facilities were open, and DHS press releases touted “record removals” under Operation Midway Blitz. In Oregon, Immergut’s ruling pointed to regular arrests and no evidence that military force was required to backstop the law.\n\nSan Francisco, meanwhile, sits in the crosshairs of rhetoric. “We’re heading to San Francisco,” Trump said on Fox. “To make it great again.”⁶ Mayor Daniel Lurie’s answer was colder: “We don’t need the Guard. Crime is down. Police recruitment is up.” Behind the scenes, California filed an amicus brief siding with Illinois at SCOTUS, citing its own experience with federalization and the Guard’s limited usefulness without arrest powers.\n\n“San Francisco neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army… stay the hell out.” — State Sen. Scott Wiener⁶\n\nEven the tech world retreated. Marc Benioff of Salesforce, who had flirted with backing the Guard during Dreamforce, issued a retraction: “After the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused.”⁶ The moment passed. The politics did not.\n\nZoom out, and the legal collision is clear: the Trump administration’s bid to recast Democratic-led cities as failed states, requiring military stabilization, keeps bouncing off the courts. In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by using Marines and federalized Guard as police during the summer sweeps.⁷ The Ninth Circuit stayed some of Breyer’s order, but his language was unmistakable.\n\n“Such conduct is a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.”⁷\n\nFrom helicopters above Portland to the armored Suburbans idling outside Broadview, the metal is loud, present, cinematic. But it’s the paper—orders, rulings, city ordinances—that keeps stopping them. The camera sees the barricades; it misses the injunction taped to a judge’s door that halts them.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling in _Trump v. Illinois_ is expected any day. If they side with the White House, limited deployments around Chicago could begin before November. If they don’t, the administration is reportedly ready to invoke the Insurrection Act—an escalation that would bypass consent and almost certainly trigger emergency litigation in California, Oregon, and beyond.² The stage is set not just for a legal showdown but for a civic reckoning.\n\nUntil then, Chicago holds the line with affidavits and local logs. Portland with helicopter-noise complaints and city-council ordinances. San Francisco with falling crime numbers and a governor’s signature on a court filing. If the troops come anyway, they’ll meet not armor but paper—thin, brittle, and legally binding.\n\nLaura’s sign still leaned against the curb, the chalk beneath it fading. A priest folded the cloth strips again. “We hold this line in peace,” she’d said earlier, her voice as calm as the wind.\n\nAnd at Broadview, the wind will still be there, lifting signs and memory and the last breath of pepper spray from the fence.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\. _State of Illinois & City of Chicago v.
