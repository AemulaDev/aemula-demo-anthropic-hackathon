  "body": "I joined Substack on December 19, 2024.\n\nWhen I realized that I let the one-year mark of my publication pass by without acknowledgment, I felt a little weird.\n\nThere’s no rule that says I have to do this, of course, but I really wanted to.\n\nThen I forgot about it yesterday.\n\nThen I remembered about it today.\n\nSo today, I want to look back on my thoughts over the past year.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SGwO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b40ede3-0a56-484b-828f-7e1ca902a6eb_1920x1080.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SGwO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b40ede3-0a56-484b-828f-7e1ca902a6eb_1920x1080.png)\n\nMy reason for joining was to create and share long-form content. I recognized then, as I do now, that there is a difference in the amount and quality of thought that goes into short-form content such as that found on X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, and TikTok vs. the amount and quality of thought that goes into writing a long-form article on Substack or Medium, or even a lengthy post on Facebook.\n\nWhen I started, I posted articles every day until I had published 100 articles. At the time, it felt like I was scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas as I approached that mark, but looking back I still wrote things that I stand by today. I slowed down after I reached 100 articles, only publiching a few articles a month; I figured that it was better to save my energy for a few articles that could get more care and attention rather than trying to come up with something new every day.\n\nI wanted to think and write about what I observed in others and in myself. What produces good conversations? What are the sources of misunderstanding and conflict? How does our desire to be heard and valued factor in? What can we do as individuals to improve the conversations we have with others?\n\nDuring this time I had finished reading Daniel Kahneman’s book _Thinking, Fast and Slow,_ and I also took part in Dr. Jennifer Weber’s “Reason over Reaction” sessions on Zoom over the summer, both of which helped shape my thinking on how we think and how we might think better by slowing down.\n\nI also have gotten some good ideas from Nick Acker, who has shared much of my work and has offered his thoughts on my writing along the way. His comments on my posts have shed light on ideas I never would have considered otherwise, and for that I am grateful.\n\nAs I kept writing, I also included raytraced images created with [POV-Ray](https://www.povray.org), and it occurred to me that what I appreciated most about raytraced images was also what I thought made for productive conversations, so I changed the name of my publication from “Gene’s Substack” to “High Resolution Conversations” to reflect this connection.\n\nI look forward to writing more in the coming year. One thing that I have been thinking about lately (as reflected in an article I shared last week) is how to organize my thoughts on conversations and think about what I might have missed. I might find that I was wrong about some things this past year, and I might need to go in a different direction. Who knows?\n\nAs my second year on Substack begins, I’m excited to continue the journey I have begun.",
