  "body": "Since I took a critical thinking course in my freshman year at Berry College, I have had an interest in logic and reasoning, along with the many ways that our reasoning goes wrong.\n\nI’ve had nearly 30 years to reflect on what I learned, and while all fallacies weaken our arguments, some fallacies are more prevalent than others, and some are more corrosive than others to shared discourse.\n\nThe straw man fallacy and begging the question are very high on my list of fallacies to avoid. Still, after thinking over comments I’ve read and discussions I have been a part of, there is another fallacy that I would include: the [genetic fallacy](https://www.scribbr.com/fallacies/genetic-fallacy/).\n\nWhy is the genetic fallacy such a problem? This fallacy is a problem because it leads us to evaluate the soundness of a claim or argument based on its source rather than the truth of its claims and the relations between those claims.\n\nGood people sometimes make bad arguments, and bad people can sometimes make good arguments. To know whether the argument is good or bad, one needs to evaluate the argument on its own terms without regard to the source. If that same source had said “2+2=4”, would you say instead that 2+2=5 simply because of the source? Or would you concede that this source was correct in making that statement?\n\nIt is often humbling to admit that our adversaries have made good arguments. But it is worth it for the sake of our own credibility. If we want to be principled rather than merely partisan, we should acknowledge such arguments as good.\n\nWe won’t always agree on everything, but let us give credit where credit is due.",
