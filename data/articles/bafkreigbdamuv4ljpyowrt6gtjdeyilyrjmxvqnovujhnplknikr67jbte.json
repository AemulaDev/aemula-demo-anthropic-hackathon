And because the speed with which so many rushed to excuse, justify, minimize, or weaponize a human death tells us something deeply unsettling about where we are as a country.\n\nAmerica is confronting an uncomfortable reality—one we _must_ face honestly if we have any hope of pulling back from the brink:\n\n**The deepest divide in this country is no longer red vs. blue.**\nIt is between those who are willing—even eager—for chaos, disdain, and distrust to become the norm…\nand those who still believe in calm, civility, trust, and civic renewal rooted in shared rules and predictable norms.\n\nAnd make no mistake: there are loud, energized factions **on both the right and the left** that now thrive on the chaos.\n\n***\n\n## When Power Replaces Principle\n\nOne of the most dangerous shifts I see today is how easily moral clarity evaporates once “our side” has power.\n\nLiberty—real liberty—used to be a principle.\nNow it’s often just a talking point.\n\nMany who rightly screamed about government overreach during COVID—lockdowns, mandates, restrictions on movement and livelihood—are now cheering as the state tramples core constitutional protections. First. Second. Fourth. Take your pick.\n\nMerely being armed—legally, with a permit—does **not** constitute a threat warranting execution in the street. That used to be a near-universal understanding. Apparently, it no longer is.\n\nWhat makes this moment especially painful for me is watching people I once respected abandon those principles.\n\nYesterday, following the killing of Alex Pretti, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem gave a public account of events that was, at best, deeply misleading—and at worst, outright false.\n\nThe gaslighting was so thorough that any anti-Second Amendment advocate would have applauded it.\n\nThis isn’t about party.\nIt’s about **truth**, **restraint**, and **moral consistency**.\n\n***\n\n## Extremes Feeding Extremes\n\nThe most vocal elements of today’s “right” now bear little resemblance to traditional conservative principles like limited government, personal accountability, or individual sovereignty. They blame every fire on the left—while pouring gasoline of their own.\n\nMeanwhile, the most vocal elements of the “left,” after years of tolerating or excusing political violence, lawfare, court packing, and disorder—from Antifa street chaos to soft-on-crime policies—point exclusively to the right as the source of all instability.\n\nBoth narratives are convenient.\nBoth are incomplete.\nAnd both are corrosive.\n\nWhat’s been quietly lost is **moral capital**—among elected officials, influencers, media figures, and movement leaders across the spectrum. Their silence when restraint is needed—or worse, their active fanning of flames—has hollowed out public trust.\n\n***\n\n## History Is Trying to Warn Us\n\nHistory doesn’t shout. It whispers—until it screams.\n\n[Colombia’s period of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Violencia) _[La Violencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Violencia)_ didn’t begin with genocide. It began with moral sorting, tribal loyalty, and the normalization of political violence as “necessary.”\n\n[Northern Ireland’s Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement) didn’t start with bombs. They started when neighbors stopped seeing one another as neighbors—and started seeing one another only as symbols.\n\nThose societies didn’t fall apart overnight.\nThey slid—slowly—because enough people decided that **winning mattered more than coexistence**.\n\nWe are not immune.\n\n***\n\n## The Silent Majority Has a Choice\n\nThere is still a large, quiet majority of Americans who do _not_ want this future.\n\nPeople who want their disagreements handled with words, not weapons.\nPeople who understand that today’s abuse of power will become tomorrow’s precedent.\nPeople who know that when norms collapse, everyone eventually pays the price.\n\nBut silence is no longer neutral.\n\nIf we leave this moment unanswered—if we keep outsourcing moral courage to extremists and algorithms—nothing gets better. Not policing. Not public safety. Not liberty. Not justice.\n\nThis is not _us vs. them_.\n\nIt is **order vs. chaos**.\n**Human dignity vs. humiliation and tribal rage**.\n**Courage vs. cowardice disguised as certainty**.\n\n***\n\n## A Call for Courageous Citizenship\n\nAt [Braver Angels,](https://BraverAngels.org) we talk about making _courageous citizenship_ the honored norm—not the exception.\n\nThat means:\n\n* Defending civil liberties **even when it’s inconvenient**\n\n* Demanding restraint **even when we’re angry**\n\n* Refusing to dehumanize **even when we feel justified**\n\n* Choosing dialogue **over dopamine**\n\nIt means remembering that democracy is not self-executing. It requires character. It requires humility. It requires us—_We the People_—to show up differently.\n\nThis is the wake-up call.\n\nNot a lecture.\n\nNot a threat.\n\nA plea.\n\nLet’s choose calm over chaos.\n\nTruth over tribalism.\n\nCivic renewal over civic decay.\n\nBefore history stops whispering.\n\n**Author’s Note:**\n_The views and reflections expressed in this essay are my own, shaped by recent events and my personal assessment of them.
