FBI. Secret Service. Virginia State Police. No raised voices. No handcuffs. Just a warrant and a phrase that has learned how to do a great deal of work in modern America: _public safety_.\n\nWien is sixty-six. She retired from American University in 2024 after a career devoted to peace studies and conflict resolution. Her protest activity—leafleting, sidewalk demonstrations, and a visit to the neighborhood of White House adviser Stephen Miller—had taken place weeks earlier. She was not accused of violence. She was not charged with a crime. Her phone was seized anyway.¹\n\nThat distinction matters. It is the distinction on which the system now quietly turns.\n\nYou do not need convictions to discipline dissent. You only need to make participation feel unsafe.\n\nWien returned home without her phone and with a sharpened awareness of how porous the boundary between protest and punishment had become. She hesitated before contacting friends. By December, federal agents had reportedly reached out to people in her circle—friends, former students—asking questions about her political activity. No charges followed. No explanation was offered. None was required.¹\n\nThe message had already landed.\n\nAt this stage, most people can still reassure themselves. Wien had protested at a private residence. Some flyers were confrontational. The episode could be framed as a lesson about tactics rather than rights. It did not yet feel like repression. It felt like boundary enforcement.\n\nThat is how the early phase works. The first cases always come with caveats.\n\nIn January 2026, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, those caveats disappeared.\n\nJessica Plichta was twenty-two years old, a preschool teacher, standing among roughly two hundred demonstrators protesting U.S. policy toward Venezuela. A local television station interviewed her live. She spoke calmly, explaining why she believed the policy was wrong and why she felt compelled to be there.\n\nSeconds after the interview ended, police arrested her—on camera.²\n\nThe stated reason was traffic obstruction and failure to comply with police orders. But Plichta was the only person arrested at the protest that day. Local police later acknowledged that no other demonstrators were cited.² The image mattered more than the charge.\n\nWithin hours, the footage circulated nationally: a young teacher finishes speaking into a microphone and is immediately taken into custody.\n\nIn teacher forums, union listservs, and private group chats, the clip was shared and discussed. The lesson did not need to be explained: political speech now carried professional risk.³\n\nThis is where repression leaves ideology and enters livelihood.\n\nTeachers. Adjuncts. Civil servants. People whose survival depends on institutions, not platforms. They do not need to be told what to think. They only need to learn what to avoid saying.\n\nWriters and scholars felt the shift more quietly, but no less forcefully. In spring and summer 2025, hundreds of National Endowment for the Humanities grants were abruptly terminated or frozen under a sweeping administrative review. Many projects were already underway—oral histories, regional archives, long-term documentary research. The cancellations were not accompanied by content bans or ideological statements. Funding was simply withdrawn.⁴\n\nInternal agency correspondence later cited “programmatic realignment.”⁴ Federal courts would eventually block the terminations, finding them likely unconstitutional.⁵ But months passed before that intervention. Staff were laid off. Fieldwork ended. Research networks dissolved.\n\nNo sentence was censored. Entire categories of inquiry were simply rendered unfundable.\n\nJournalists noticed the pattern from a distance—until it arrived at their own doors.\n\nOn January 14, 2026, federal agents searched the Virginia home of _Washington Post_ reporter Hannah Natanson and seized her electronic devices as part of a leak investigation. Natanson was not accused of a crime. Her employer was not charged. The Justice Department later stated that she was “not a target.”⁶\n\nThat was precisely the point.\n\nThe action was aimed past her, toward every current and future source. Anyone inside government who had ever considered speaking to a reporter now had a vivid image to consider: agents leaving a journalist’s home carrying laptops, phones, even a smartwatch. The law had shifted just enough to permit it. Fear filled the gap.⁷\n\nThis is the mechanism Martin Niemöller was describing—not the scale of violence, but the sequence of accommodation.\n\n“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—\n\nBecause I was not a socialist.”⁸\n\nIn late 2025 and early 2026, federal courts began confronting cases involving non-citizen academics and students targeted after engaging in pro-Palestinian speech. In Boston, U.S. District Judge William Young accused the administration of retaliating based on viewpoint, using immigration enforcement as the mechanism.⁹ Visas were questioned. Status reviews initiated. Detentions occurred without criminal charges.¹⁰\n\nFor those affected, speech was no longer an abstract right. It was a liability tied to residence, family, and future.\n\nColleagues noticed. Invitations were declined. Panels were softened. Opinions were edited before being spoken.\n\nNo statute banned dissent.\n\nThe consequences made dissent irrational.\n\nThe pattern sharpened further in January 2026, when the American Academy of Pediatrics saw nearly $12 million in federal funding abruptly terminated after publicly criticizing administration health policy. A federal judge blocked the move, finding it likely unconstitutional retaliation.¹¹ But again, the intervention came after the signal.\n\nAdvocacy now carried institutional risk.\n\nThis is the stage that rarely registers as repression. It begins with selective consequences—applied just unevenly enough to remain legally arguable.\n\nOnly later does the language harden.\n\nNational security. Sovereignty. Extremism. Emergency.\n\nOnly later do the arrests stop needing cameras.\n\n“Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”⁸\n\nNiemöller was not describing a sudden collapse. He was describing **anticipatory compliance**—the phase in which people silence themselves before they are ordered to.\n\nBarbara Wien still lives in her house. Jessica Plichta is not in prison. Hannah Natanson is still a reporter. Courts have intervened, sometimes just in time. This is not yet full authoritarianism.\n\nBut it is no longer merely political conflict.\n\nIt is **soft repression**: a system in which speech remains formally legal, but participation is governed by risk; where punishment is sporadic, deniable, and asymmetric; and where silence spreads not because it is demanded, but because it is rational.\n\nBy the time dissent becomes illegal, most of the work has already been done.\n\nAnd by then, no announcement is necessary.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
