Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nBreaking: Trump imposing new tariff on China in response to rare earth materials restrictions. An escalation from the current average rate on China of 57% this additional tariff if implemented would push the rate above 150% essentially ending trade with China. Also export controls on Chinese software would be partially included, an escalation from the previous tariffs based primarily on goods.\n\nIt’s going to be a wild weekend.\n\nTrump basically just ended trade with China, or at least that’s how it sounds. I’d give it maybe a 30 percent chance (or less) that this actually sticks.\n\nMore likely than not, some kind of agreement will emerge over the weekend and markets will bounce back Monday. Still, this could be the big one. If it goes through, it’s much worse than most people realize. We’re talking about a full economic war with the world’s second largest economy.\n\nI’m no crypto expert, but for stocks, higher tariffs mean higher input costs for everything: materials, services, even labor. That trickles down fast. Businesses cut costs, people lose jobs, consumers spend less, revenues fall, profits shrink, and stock prices drop. That’s the ingredients for a recession.\n\nBefore we all agree the world ends tomorrow, it’s worth noting this was probably announced on a Friday for a reason. Markets are closed for the weekend, and Monday is a federal holiday. That gives everyone time to cool off, read the details, and maybe dial back the panic.\n\nStill, there’s always a chance this one actually sticks, and if it does, we could be looking at a drawdown, going toward contraction, within three months. I’m not ready to make that call yet. Give it twenty four to forty eight hours.\n\nFor context, China fired the first shot by restricting rare earth exports. The United States hit back with tariffs. Now China will almost certainly respond, and Trump will respond again, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, China could back off its restrictions and Trump might cut a deal. But for now, buckle up.\n\nAdditionally, us being on the 10th day of the government shutdown, although not directly impactful, is adding to the chaos.\n\nDon’t make any rash decisions until at least Monday or Tuesday and more information is provided. Take a deep breath and lose your brokerage account password for the next few days.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
