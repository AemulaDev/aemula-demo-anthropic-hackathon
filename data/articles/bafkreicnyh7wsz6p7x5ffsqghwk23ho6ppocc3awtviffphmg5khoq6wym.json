Although I understand in my heart that truth, it’s another thing to live that out in practice, and yet in 1 Corinthians 10, the apostle Paul highlights exactly how powerful our Lord is. Paul’s writing reminds me that as a young man striving for Christlikeness, I am no better than any other sinner, but I am called to act differently.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Jus!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405a0650-4cef-4129-8c98-2d9d30e92a61_1536x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5Jus!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405a0650-4cef-4129-8c98-2d9d30e92a61_1536x1024.png)\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:1 (NIV)**\n\n_For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea._\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 10, Paul points the Corinthians back to Israel’s shared spiritual history to warn them that proximity to God’s blessings does not guarantee faithfulness. Israel communed together, eating the same spiritual food and drinking from the same spiritual drink, all drawing from the spiritual rock that was Christ. Yet, God was not pleased with many of them.\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:8 (NIV)**\n\n_We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died._\n\nMany pursued worldly pleasures, idolatry, and tested God. Many fell as a result, including the twenty-three thousand who died. Their story is meant as a warning for us, reminding us that shared participation in spiritual things does not excuse sin or protect us from its consequences. Actions alone can not bring us salvation.\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:13 (NIV)**\n\n_No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it._\n\nPaul then turns to the reality of temptation, emphasizing that it is universal and unavoidable, but that God is faithful: He does not give us more than we can endure and always provides a way through it. God enables endurance, not avoidance, which calls us to remain alert and disciplined rather than apathetic or overconfident.\n\nLike Peter falling asleep in the garden and later denying Christ, carelessness often precedes failure, and we cannot afford to consider sin, even fleeting thoughts we believe we would never act on. While we cannot control the first thought, we are responsible for taking captive the second, as modeled by Joseph fleeing from Potiphar’s wife.\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:16 (NIV)**\n\n_Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?_\n\nPaul then reminds us that as the body of Christ, we are nourished from one source alone: Christ’s body and blood, whose sacrifice provides grace and mercy and is the only means of salvation.\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:23 (NIV)**\n\n_I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive._\n\nBecause of this exclusive devotion, we cannot mix worship or participate in pagan practices, as we cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. Paul addresses Christian freedom by clarifying that while we are permitted to receive what God has created, not everything permissible is beneficial, and liberty must be exercised with discernment.\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:25 (NIV)**\n\n_Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,_\n\nIn the Corinthian context, food was often tied to pagan sacrifice. Still, the issue was not the meat itself, but rather whether participation crossed into worship or violated conscience.\n\nChristians are not bound by pagan fears, yet we are also not free to act selfishly, as our freedom must be governed by love and concern for others, seeking not our own good but the good of those around us. This freedom also demands discipline, because if something consumes my time, attention, and thoughts, it may need to be removed, even if it is technically allowed.\n\n**1 Corinthians 10:31 (NIV)**\n\n_So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God._\n\nPriorities must be ordered correctly, with the largest rocks placed first, starting with the cornerstone, Christ. Building on that foundation means making a daily commitment to spending time in His Word, and in constant prayer and worship, because what I devote my time to reveals the condition of my heart and what I truly value.\n\nSubmitting to God means humbling myself before Him, casting my anxieties and sins onto Him, and following through on my commitment to Christ, trusting that as I spend more time with Him, my thoughts will begin to align with His and my desires will shift from earthly cravings to godly ones.\n\nA consistent quiet time is not about checking a box or merely avoiding bad behavior, but about cultivating a genuine delight in God, because without that delight, we will eventually stumble.\n\nAs Christians, we submit ourselves to a higher standard. We will be held accountable for how we live, recognizing that meaningful ministry to others begins with personal faithfulness.\n\nSometimes obedience looks like silence, choosing to listen to God rather than filling every moment with noise, and ultimately living in a way that reflects Paul’s final call to seek not our own good, but the good of others.\n\n_I am praying daily for a clear mind and discernment before going into the world, not after I am already surrounded by temptation. If I knowingly place myself in situations that lead toward sin, I am not being faithful or wise._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
