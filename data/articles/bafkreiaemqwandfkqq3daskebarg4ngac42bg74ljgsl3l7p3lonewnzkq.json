  "title": "Media, Vibe Coding, And The Long Tail: My Talk from HOPE_16",
  "preview": "A talk I gave in August 2025 at Hackers On Planet Earth",
  "body": "In 2025, I was invited to speak at the 16th installment of Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE). This week, the talks were uploaded to Youtube, and you can watch my talk below. My talk was about my model of what media is and does, plus some thoughts about where it might go in the future, given advances in AI technology.\n\nNotes before we get started:\n• “Vibe coding” is a phrase that describes a new form of coding, where a creator simply tells an AI what she wants, and the AI builds it. This means that non-coders (like me?) are becoming empowered to build our own software, including websites, apps, etc.\n\n• I was invited to give this talk after I wrote the post “[Vibe Coding and The Future of Media: I (Sort Of) Built An AI Fact-Checker](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-and-the-future-of-media)” in April 2025.\n\n• I gave this talk about six months ago. Since then, vibe coding has _already_ advanced quite a bit. On the third slide, I talked about the process I used. This process is already out of date!\n\n• However, most of this talk is not about the vibe coding process — it’s about media forms, and about how I expect the technology to move forward.\n\n{{youtube:tEZAM0cbVUU}}\n\nRe-watching this talk is interesting. I need to practice my public speaking more! I watch the talk and I feel like my ideas are just tumbling around like kittens. Nonetheless, the audience at HOPE seemed to enjoy it. So, hopefully you’ll enjoy it too.\n\nThank you very much to HOPE for inviting me, and to the people who hosted me and gave feedback on the talk beforehand. You know who you are!\n\n•\n\n—\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
