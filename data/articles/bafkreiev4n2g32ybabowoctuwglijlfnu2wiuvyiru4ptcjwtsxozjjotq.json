Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\n_This is a recent homework assignment for my Business and Professional Development class. Little did my professor know that planning is my future career path as well as a part-time obsession. What was supposed to be a simple three-goal exercise turned into a macro-level breakdown of how I am running my life this year. Call it overkill, or call it content. Either way, here's the overview\\._\n\nI've always been a planner, sometimes to the point where my friends joke that I overplan. They might be right. My Google Calendar is always open on my laptop, color-coded with workouts, meals, finances, and everything in between. Planning is not just a habit for me; it is how I keep life moving forward with direction and purpose without going nuts.\n\n### **Financial Growth and Independence**\n\nMy first goal is financial growth and independence. I currently manage three investment funds: two focused on the long term, with a target of 2075 in mind, and one built for shorter and medium-term needs. I plan to keep contributing steadily, even if the amounts are smaller, while I am in college. At a minimum, I will auto-draft $25 a week into my accounts to maintain consistency and discipline. To increase contributions, I will continue side hustles like DoorDash and writing for The Niner Times, while cutting back on unnecessary expenses to free up as much cash as possible for investing.\n\n### **Academic and Career Development**\n\nMy second goal is to graduate from UNC Charlotte with a finance degree in Spring 2027, complete my CFP coursework, and secure an entry-level finance role in Charlotte by that summer. To make this possible, I will take at least 15 credit hours each semester and target a GPA above 3.5. I will also stay active in the Charlotte Economics Club and the UNCC Investing Club, while keeping my résumé and LinkedIn current. I want future employers, and eventually clients, to see not only my grades but also my consistency and involvement in the professional community.\n\n### **Newsletter Growth**\n\nMy third goal is to continue growing my personal finance newsletter. By the end of 2025, I plan to reach 100 subscribers and 1,000 monthly readers. By the end of 2026, I aim to expand our audience to 500 subscribers and 5,000 monthly readers. To achieve this, I will publish one article every week on personal finance, investing, and college-level money management. I will cross-post content to The Niner Times and LinkedIn, adapt pieces for different audiences, and continue to expand to platforms like Instagram. Most importantly, I will listen to my audience, peers, and friends at UNC Charlotte to refine my writing strategy and keep my writing relevant.\n\n### **Looking Forward**\n\nI am excited for the years ahead. The foundation I have built in financial discipline, academic commitment, and writing is already pushing me toward my goals. I know not everything will work on the first try, and I expect to fail more often than I would like, but each day moves me forward. Every article I publish is practice for the next one. Every paper I turn in is a step toward graduation. And while I may be known as an obsessive planner, I also know when to close my laptop, walk out the door, and make memories with the people around me.\n\n_So yeah, I basically hijacked a class assignment and turned it into my 2025 playbook. At least I didn't hit my professor with STSR CAGR simulations, CEF withdrawal strategies, or SGF 10Q filings research notes…_\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
