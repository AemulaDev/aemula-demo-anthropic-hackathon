  "body": "Many of you already know this: I used to write about sexuality, under the pseudonym [Clarisse Thorn](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/a-couple-of-my-old-books-in-pdf). Recently I received a request from [Chesed](https://x.com/Chesedgirl), who posts about sex on Twitter/X. She loved my past work as Clarisse, and so Chesed asked me to speak at an event she’s co-organizing, which is called Slutcon.\n\nI said yes because I always really appreciate hearing from fans, and because I have a topic related to sex and romance that I’m interested in discussing in an outside-the-box way: Modern family formation.\n\nI think about this stuff a lot and I track numerous commentators about it, on both sides of the political aisle. I get the sense that many people who know me from [my presence in right-wing communities](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-was-part-of-the-neoreactionary) are unsure how to think about my past as a sex writer and sex educator. And honestly, it is somewhat strange for me to think about, too. It’s been a long time since I felt like that carefree girl, Clarisse.\n\nI have not been promiscuous, by any definition, in years. In fact, I have not had any sex at all for the last three years. This is not because I think it would be wrong if I did, but because (a) I’ve been busy, and (b) I have been recovering from a literal, diagnosed case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after my relationship with the father of my child, which ended in a pretty spectacular way. (I wrote a bit about that relationship and its aftermath in [my recent post about cancel culture](https://www.emilybynight.com/p/how-i-got-canceled-by-the-left-and).) Also — and I think this might be more important — my feelings about sex and relationships have shifted as my spiritual practice deepened. In 2023 I wrote a short post called “[Fidelity](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/fidelity)” about that.\n\nI am pleased to report that I managed to express direct attraction to a man recently, which felt like a movement towards healing. I occasionally date. I have had minimal physical contact with any of the men I’ve dated in the last few years. I would like to fall in love again and have a family with a man who I love, and I hope that happens. I am not sure if I should expect it to happen or not.\n\nI often consider trying to write something about sexuality, romance, and the family. I have many thoughts, and a few drafts lying around. To me the current public Discourse on these topics feels worse than ever, deeply unhealthy and tragic. But I also find it difficult to know where to intervene in that Discourse. The closest I’ve gotten was a post earlier this year called “[Sex and Power](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/sex-and-power),” which one might say was a post about sexual politics.\n\nSo anyway, I’ll be at Slutcon, which feels a bit ironic given all the above! My session is called “New Angles in Family Formation: AMA with Lydia Laurenson.” If you are a paid subscriber to my Substack then I can bring you into my talk as a guest; just let me know if you’d like to attend. (I can’t get you into the whole event — you’d have to buy a ticket for that — but I can get you into my talk.) More info for paid subscribers below.\n\n[Read more](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/ill-be-talking-about-family-at-slutcon)\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
