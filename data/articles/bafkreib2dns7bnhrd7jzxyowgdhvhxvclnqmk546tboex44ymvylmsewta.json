  "body": "Okay, I was wrong. I didn’t think this partial government shutdown would last more than a week, maybe two.\n\nWe’re now in week three, and there’s no end in sight. This one might beat the record established during the first Trump Administration, [which lasted 35 days](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54937).\n\nWhat’s really weird is how everyone seems to be taking this in stride, even the legacy media. That’s likely because there have been no clear political consequences thus far. Polls are all over the map, but basically, average voters are saying 1) meh, and 2) a pox on both houses.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5P3B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4712e2e-9d6f-43aa-a53d-134dd256087b_640x360.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5P3B!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4712e2e-9d6f-43aa-a53d-134dd256087b_640x360.jpeg)\n\nThis is also weird, since the party most associated with shutting down the government, precipitating it, usually gets the political hit. The facts obviously point to Democrats, especially in the Senate, who have voted not just 10 times against “continuining resolutions” to keep the doors open, with no changes in policies or appropriation levels - a “clean CR,” in Washington-speak - but even against a very bipartisan defense appropriation bill that would at least allow our Armed Services personnel to get their paycheck this week.\n\nEven Virginia’s two Democratic U.S. senators, who represent the nation’s third-largest contingent of soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen (_airpersons?_), Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, voted against paychecks for 115,000 constituents (and that’s just those claiming Virginia as their official residence). Only California and Texas have more active-duty military personnel than the Commonwealth of Virginia. Warner is up for reelection in 2026 and deserves to be defeated. Only California has more federal employees, with neighboring Maryland in hot pursuit.\n\nIt was noteworthy this week that the _Washington Post_, the official organ of ~~government Democrats Deep State~~ the Administrative State, which enthusiastically blames Republicans for any harm to federal employees and government programs (except defense), went radio silent on the shutdown at least once this week. The same holds for many of their fellow travelers. Even more remarkable is that it appears the shutdown is having virtually no impact on [Virginia’s highly competitive state elections on November 4th](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/hey-look-we-have-elections-in-new).\n\nAlso noteworthy is the absurdity of the reasons for this shutdown. Democrats, by virtue of their own proposed legislative changes, not only want to extend _temporary_ subsidies to upper middle-class and wealthy Obamacare policyholders, with the money going directly into the ever-loving arms of insurance companies, but also restore Medicaid funding for illegal aliens and able-bodied 18-64 year olds _who don’t want to work_ or even do community service for _at least 20 hours a week_. They also want to restore subsidies to their favored government media outlets, National Public Radio and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nOf course, the _real reasons_ are purely political. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) supported a nearly identical continuing resolution to keep the government open just seven months ago, but was criticized by the far left of his party for it. Keeping the “base” happy is priority one for Schumer (and most party leaders, frankly), since he badly wants 1) campaign cash and 2) a return to Democratic control of the US Senate. It’s all about power, and if it means holding federal employees and military personnel hostage, _so be it_. The ends justify the means.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0dqL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098fd31e-79f6-4af2-82bf-28dcfed805f8_1000x666.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0dqL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098fd31e-79f6-4af2-82bf-28dcfed805f8_1000x666.jpeg)\n\nSome say he’s fearful of a primary challenge in 2028 when, at age 78, with more than 50 years in Washington, he’ll be up for reelection. That sounds interesting, but it’s unpersuasive; 2028 is a few political lifetimes away. He fears leftists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) for other reasons, like drying up contributions to Democratic Senate candidates, angering The Left’s shock troops, creating divisions and distractions, and depressing turnout. His own latest fundraising numbers are reportedly paltry.\n\nMore weirdness - there are many Republicans, including the iconoclastic Marjorie Taylor-Greene, who also want to ~~extort~~ extend taxpayer dollars to wealthier Obamacare recipients (people who don’t have access to employer or other government health insurance). They complain that without the tax dollars of truck drivers, small business owners, nurses, and others, premiums would double for wealthier Obamacare subscribers. Never mind that Obamacare - which was laughably called “The Affordable Care Act” - was not originally set up to subsidize higher earners, or families making $128,000 _or more_ per year. The Inflation Reduction Act’s expansion of Obamacare subsidies eliminated income caps and resulted in an [explosion of fraud Obamacare enrollees](https://amac.us/newsline/politics/democrats-didnt-shut-down-the-government-over-health-care-they-did-it-to-protect-obamacare-subsidies-fraud/?utm_objective=website_traffic\\&utm_source=email\\&utm_campaign=amac\\&utm_medium=daily_news_pm\\&utm_content=dds101625\\&dderh=155a58d17f016f634f120eaef0a44c57).\n\nThere’s another story here about how many Trump Republicans have embraced big, expensive, and dubious government solutions to issues, but I’ll save that for another day. _It’s a big problem_.\n\nObviously, Obamacare was never “affordable.” Obama’s vaunted legacy, while it did extend insurance coverage to previously uninsured people through massive government subsidies, especially to Medicaid, has proven to be a _disaster_. Before the practical elimination of income caps for subsidies, a self-employed couple would have paid approximately $33,000 in premiums and deductibles before _any_ coverage was applied. I know, because a few of you have mentioned it to me. I’ve also experienced it to a degree before my spouse and I both became eligible for Medicare. Meanwhile, Medicaid expansion is now one of the most significant factors contributing to our growing national debt, with nearly $1 trillion in annual payments to cover the interest on that debt, let alone pay it down.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!naVA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a9c0fd7-95ac-4220-b48b-91558af244e6_530x559.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!naVA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a9c0fd7-95ac-4220-b48b-91558af244e6_530x559.png)\n\nThis is your reminder (as if you were really ever told) that President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress “temporarily” expanded Obamacare subsidies for almost everyone as part of another laughably named bill, the trillion-dollar “[Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/inflation-reduction-act-health-insurance-subsidies-what-is-their-impact-and-what-would-happen-if-they-expire/)” As US Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) [correctly noted this week](https://gop.com/rapid-response/senate-democrat-blows-up-partys-shutdown-narrative/), _it was Democrats, not Republicans, who designed the expanded benefits to expire at the end of this year_. They were only expanded because of COVID. The last time I checked, the COVID-19 “emergency” was over, [declared so by Joe Biden himself](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/11/1169191865/biden-ends-covid-national-emergency).\n\nWith all that out of the way, what’s the best way not only to end the shutdown but make sure we don’t go through these absurd political charades ever again? And are Senator Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats actually trying to bait Republicans to do something they’ve already promised to do if and when they take power?\n\n_**First, the obvious way to end government shutdowns would be to follow the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. You know, pass budgets and appropriations bills on time, before the end of a fiscal year, so “continuing resolutions” aren’t necessary.**_\n\n_**If wishes and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a Merry Christmas. Congress hasn’t strictly followed the 1974 Budget Act since I began working in Congress in FY79.**_\n\nThe answer to the question above is yes, and it might actually be worth it for Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to take the bait, even as it would appear that Thune might be bailing out Schumer and his colleagues, _politically_. Three Senate Democrats, including Fetterman, have already voted against Schumer to reopen the government; 20 House Democrats have signed on to replace House Democratic Leader Hakim Jeffries (D-NY) as their floor leader. That’s usually an indication of Democratic weakness, but no others have caved as behind-the-scenes conversations continue.\n\nBut as Fetterman himself has said, it’s time to put the country over the party. And sometimes, throughout history, Senate leaders have bailed out their counterparts. Not that Thune can ever count on Schumer to return the favor.\n\n[![President George W. Bush shakes hands with US Senator Jim Talent 03 November 2006 at a campaign rally in Joplin, Missouri. Bush will spend the day...](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qq1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e904290-eb19-4a7e-9d95-621ef22f6cd0_500x347.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qq1z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e904290-eb19-4a7e-9d95-621ef22f6cd0_500x347.jpeg)\n\n*Former US Sen. James Talent (R-MO) with former President George W. Bush during Talent’s unsuccessful 2006 reelection. It was a rough year for the GOP.*\n\nI credit the idea to former US Senator James Talent (R-MO), now a fellow with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Bipartisan Policy Center. I suspect that smart staff and advisors have also come up with the idea. He suggested to radio talker Hugh Hewitt on the air Thursday afternoon that the votes might be there for Thune, for the second time this Congress, to invoke the “nuclear option” and change Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote supermajority requirement. Except this time, it would be narrowly and specifically limited to “clean” continuing resolutions that neither raise nor lower spending levels, and don’t include “policy” issues, all to prevent a minority in the Senate from shutting down the government.\n\nI suspect the Majority Leader has considered that and is checking to see if 51 GOP votes are there to do it. As a reminder, the “nuclear option” refers to the Majority Leader's move to overturn a ruling by the chair on a procedural or rule matter, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes. The motion limits the scope of the “rule change.” It’s an idea that’s been around since the mid-19th century. Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked it in 2013 to stack the District of Columbia Court of Appeals with Barack Obama's nominees, but limited its application to non-Supreme Court nominees. Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used it to confirm three Trump Supreme Court nominees a few years later (Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett).\n\nNot that he wants to, or should. He’s already on the record, and rightfully so, against eliminating the filibuster for legislation. It has already been eliminated for judicial nominations (2013 and 2017) and executive nominations (2013). Thune invoked it earlier this summer to end an _unprecedented_ obstruction of hundreds of “secondary” nominees (e.g., undersecretaries and assistant secretaries) for policy-making positions in the Trump Administration that require the advice and consent of the Senate. The “new rule” allows for nominations to be considered en masse and on an expedited basis, except for Cabinet-level and Supreme Court nominees.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mmPG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06526289-95b3-4f19-8bcd-47a933bf1035_660x385.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mmPG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06526289-95b3-4f19-8bcd-47a933bf1035_660x385.png)\n\n*My neighbor, retired Navy Captain Hung Cao, was recently confirmed as Undersecretary of the Navy after Senate Majority Leader John Thune invoked the “nuclear option” to end the unprecedented delays in his and others’ confirmations. Cao regretfully lost to Tim Kaine in Virginia’s 2024 Senate race. He would have been a massive improvement.*\n\nIt’s evident to me that Senator Schumer and other partisan Democrats want the GOP to eliminate the filibuster so they don’t have to, even as they’ve proposed and promised to do so when they return to power. And when that happens, including a Democratic trifecta of the White House and both houses of Congress, _Katy bar the door._ Envision packing a 13 or 15-member US Supreme Court, outlawing voter ID, the “Green New Deal,” and all manner of _evil._ _Our Constitutional Republic will officially end._ That’s not an exaggeration. *It would be a government without brakes, much less checks and balances.* The stakes are that high.\n\nI’ve long argued that eliminating the filibuster in the Senate would not only undercut the Senate's organizational purpose but also _destroy it_. The consequences would be turbulent and chaotic, as laws and rules would swing wildly back and forth with every change in power _(if Republicans weren’t legislated out of existence_). It would further our descent into banana-republic status, as if we aren’t well on our way.\n\nHaving said that, if I were a U.S. senator, I’d be thinking long and hard about voting for Thune to launch the nuclear option, _very narrowly_, a second time. I _hate_ the idea, but as a matter of public policy, we need to eliminate the ability of a small minority to shut down the government and threaten public health and safety.\n\nA second option is to adopt [legislation](https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-moves-bill-to-end-government-shutdowns/) by Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), initially proposed in 2019, that would provide for automatic continuing resolutions to keep the government open, while requiring Congress to remain in Washington seven days a week until the budget work is complete. Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and US Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) provide for 14-day automatic continuing resolutions. I prefer the Lankford-Hassan bill.\n\nHowever, both bills are subject to the Rule XII supermajority requirement for consideration, requiring 60 votes for consideration.\n\nHopefully, enough Democrats will come to their senses and work out an arrangement that will get them a reasonable solution on Obamacare subsidies (_not that there is one, in my opinion_) and end this expensive, disruptive, stupid, and irresponsible partial closure of government. Maybe the Lankford-Hassan legislation can be part of the deal. Air traffic controllers and our military personnel deserve to be paid, along with other emergency services personnel.\n\nMake no mistake, the facts are clear: This ridiculous and unnecessary shutdown is on Senator Chuck Schumer and about 45 Senate Democrats, including the idiots who represent me here in Virginia. Taking another swipe at the filibuster is anathema to every fiber of my being. However, sometimes real leaders need to step up and put an end to the nonsense, even if it is painful.\n\nIn this case, the ends might well justify the means.",
