  "preview": "Some starting notes towards a policy for commenters on my posts",
  "body": "This post contains two things:\n\n• **A policy for commenters on my Substack** that also generally applies (in a form adapted to the platforms in question) to those who interact with my stuff elsewhere on social media\n\n• **Some discussion of my relevant history** with blogging and social platforms\n\n### My Policy in Bullet Points\n\nI would like to keep this simple.\n\n**If a comment irritates me, or strikes me as bad faith, I will do one of two things:**\n\n1. Immediately delete the comment and ban the commenter without warning, or\n\n2. Give some warning to the commenter that I didn’t like their comment and why, at which point they have a choice about how to respond. If I don’t like their response, I’ll delete the offending comment and/or ban them, but if I think their response is reasonable then I will be clear about that and thank them.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the policy.\n\n**Appeals process:** If a commenter feels that I was unfair in deleting their comment and banning them, they have the option of finding me in some other medium (I’m all over the internet) and reaching out there, to let me know. (Or, if we have mutual friends, they can reach out that way.) I try to be nice to most everyone on the internet, especially if they’re going to the trouble to engage with my stuff; at the same time, I also try to have a zero-tolerance policy when people are being dicks and should know better. Sometimes this means I’m overly harsh towards people who really were doing their best.\n\n**Note: If readers and other posters can be patient with me on viral and/or emotionally sensitive posts, it helps me a lot.** ❤️ **It is very difficult for me to stay steady towards the audience when I have a post (or posts) going viral, because viral posts rapidly accrue feedback. Much of this feedback tends to be negative no matter what the topic, but the positive feedback can be emotionally destabilizing as well. It is hard to describe how overwhelming this can feel; suffice to say, it’s a significant challenge. Thank you for your patience.**\n\n### My History With This Stuff and Why I Am Doing It This Way\n\nI started blogging with Livejournal circa 2000, and I made my first Wordpress blog in, I think, 2008-ish. I’ve been on Twitter/X under various names since 2009, and I’ve played around on many other social platforms, some of which have long since ended their time on this Earth. My writing about internet media has appeared in multiple outlets [including](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-love-and-care-about-pseudonyms) _[The Atlantic](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-love-and-care-about-pseudonyms)_ and _[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/search?term=lydia+laurenson),_ and I’ve also worked on multiple platforms behind the scenes in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen I started blogging, I felt very opposed to deleting comments, ever. I still remember the first commenter I banned on my Clarisse Thorn blog because I agonized about it for days. I worried so much! I worried about hurting people’s feelings. I worried about degrading discourse quality and creating unintended chilling effects on other commenters. I worried that I was overly catering to my own ego, or discarding feedback that might make me a better, kinder, more thoughtful person.\n\nI also _loved_ a lot of my commenters, especially when I was writing full-time. Honestly, I still do. I really, truly, genuinely love the relationships that exist on social media. Some of these relationships are somewhat or entirely fake (the phrase “[parasocial interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction)” is often used for how media consumers can feel about celebrities), but those are not the relationships I’m talking about.\n\nI am aware that there are people I don’t interact with who read my material and have feelings about me (hi); I try to keep that in mind and have some sense of those people’s experience; calling this “parasocial” feels a little weird, though maybe that’s what it is? But what feels truly _special_ is when I develop relationships with people who comment, or who create their own top-level material, and we connect in that ineffable way.\n\nThis is the main reason, for me, it feels hard to shut down comments or take a stern hand to them. Yet at the same time, over the years I’ve come to see that one has the potential to create something more beautiful and rare through comment management than by not doing it.\n\nThere was much conversation on this topic in the teens. 2013 was the first year that a major media organization [decided to shut down their comments section entirely](https://www.npr.org/2013/09/26/226553008/popular-science-web-comments-are-bad-for-science); others quickly followed suit (here’s [a 2013](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-psychology-of-online-comments) _[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-psychology-of-online-comments)_ [piece](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-psychology-of-online-comments) about comments and related phenomena). During this era, studies began demonstrating something that I’d long suspected, which was that the comments section _can influence how readers interpret an article._ In particular, the first comment under an article can — and often will — completely change how readers interpret the article. I suspect something similar is true for, say, the first reply under a post on Twitter/X.\n\nSo this is why I take this question so seriously. This is about relationships I care about and about people expressing themselves, and simultaneously, it is also about how _my_ output gets interpreted.\n\nA problem here is that putting a lot of energy into comment management reaches burnout territory, fast. That’s part of why I’ve settled on such a basic policy. The reality is that a commenter who’s determined to burn up my energy can very effectively do that. I’m not sure internet randos understand the level of impact they can have through comments, reply tweets, etc. The impact can be immense! I want to be “fair to everyone,” but the more energy I put into that, the more surface area it creates for careless commenters to burn me out.\n\nI also think that most people who are doing anything on the internet these days have some sense of norms, and that if someone shows up with a specific tone or attitude (especially if it’s not a new account), then their tone and attitude is not accidental and they can be held accountable for it immediately. This is why I don’t have a “three strikes you’re out” policy or similar.\n\nOn Twitter/X this policy has manifested as me becoming increasingly willing to block people who are dicks to me. I don’t like doing this, at all, but it’s made my experience of the platform much better.\n\nSubstack has an option that a lot of other platforms don’t, which is restricting comments on a given post to paid subscribers, even if the post itself is not restricted to paid subscribers. I like this option because it creates the potential for a commenting community of people who are genuinely invested in a given writer’s work, within which hopefully better norms can more easily prevail. We’ll see how it works over time here on my Substack.\n\n—\n\n•\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
