She explains how societies don’t just lose free expression through force—but through fear, conformity, and silence.\n\n⛔This episode isn’t about **outrage**.\n\n✅It’s about responsibility.\n\n✅It’s about authenticity.\n\n✅And it’s about why the silent majority must rediscover its voice.\n\n### 🔗 Learn More & connect with Katherine Brodsky\n\n**Website:** <https://katherinewrites.com>\n\n**X (Twitter)**: <https://x.com/mysteriouskat>\n\n**YouTube**: <https://www.youtube.com/c/randommindschannel>\n\nThe world is a better place if we are better people.
