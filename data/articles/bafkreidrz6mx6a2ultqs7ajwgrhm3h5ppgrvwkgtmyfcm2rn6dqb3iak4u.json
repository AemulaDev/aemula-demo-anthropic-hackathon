  "body": "My reader may recall that about three years ago, I published on this blog an 11-part series, a virtual tour of the US Capitol. I didn’t get my first tour of the Capitol until nearly 16 years in Washington, and not until I was confirmed as the 28th Secretary of the Senate.\n\nSince my first tour, led by the then-Associate Historian of the US Senate, Don Ritchie, in 1995, I’ve gone on to conduct dozens of tours for groups and individuals from all over the world, from an Italian Senator representing North America (the late Ron Turano, a baker from Chicago) to a diverse, multi-partisan group of legislators from Pakistan and frequent tours for career government officials from Canada. I’ve also collected and read a wide variety of books on the Capitol’s and America’s history, from “_Our Land of Hope_” by Wilfred McClay, perhaps the most concise book written on American history, and excellent publications by Senate Historian Emeritus Dr. Richard Baker, including “_200 Notable Days,_” Senate Stories from 1787 to 2002.\n\nThe Senate’s estimable [website](https://www.senate.gov/history/essays.htm), which I helped launched with the Senate’s first webmaster, Christopher Lee, and Cherie Allen, remains a fabulous resource on Senate history and activities. I cannot more highly recommend it. A favorite memory is [conducting a press conference](https://www.c-span.org/program/news-conference/senate-world-wide-web-page/52875) in the Senate’s media gallery with the Chairman of the Senate’s Rules Committee, the late US Sen. John Warner (R-VA), to unveil the new resource.\n\nThey’re all special and memorable, which is why I mention them, but none more so than watching the eyes of a young adult or teenager light up with learning and being captivated by standing in the place of remarkable history. I love inspiring among young people about American history and government.\n\nI’ve now converted my 11-part blog series into a single eBook, “_Walk Through History,_” which I’m making available to my subscribers here in a PDF format. No charge; you’re welcome to download or share it. I’ve updated it with a few more historical events, personal observations, recollections, and corrections since that original series.\n\n[You can find the link here](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:920aee9c-0eff-4c23-9449-aae8c29e24d6) and below. It will soon be available on Amazon via Kindle for the exorbitant fee of $2.99. Over the next couple of weeks, I plan to create an audio version via this Substack site, along with an old-fashioned print edition.\n\nFor this, you may need to have or download a free copy of Adobe Reader, which is [widely available](https://get.adobe.com/reader/). Feel free to share. You may need to copy and paste it on your browser, but I’ve tested it and it seems to work (for now).\n\nAt worst, it will cure your insomnia.\n\nIf you have a problem accessing it, email me at <kellyjohnston@reagan.com>, and I’ll be glad to send you a PDF version. I’m working on printing a few hundred old-fashioned paperbacks (it’s only about 74 pages).\n\nSpecial credit to the Senate’s and the Architect of the Capitol’s websites for many of the photos and information. And, of course, Senate Historian Emeritus Don Ritchie for inspiring me through my first tour 30 years ago. I’m especially grateful to the Senate and House Sergeant at Arms and their offices for helping facilitate my tours, and dedicate the book to all who have served the institution, our Article I branch, Members and staff. We’re all part of an extended family.\n\nUltimately, I am in the eternal debt of the late Robert J. Dole (R-KS), who nominated me to serve as the 28th Secretary of the Senate, and the mentors who made that possible, including former US Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and the late Charles Drew, the general manager of the Chickasha Daily Express in Oklahoma who took a big gamble on a young college activist and helped launch his professional career in 1976. There are many others too numerous to name here. _You know who you are_.\n\nComments, critiques, and corrections are welcome. I’m sure there’s a grammatical error or typo that my Grammarly software and I may have missed. Feel free to alert me to them and I’ll fix them for future editions, and perhaps a preface or forward maybe if I can interest someone in writing one. Perhaps you’d like to share an endorsement. I can include those, too, in future editions. I’m also looking forward to recording an audio version that I’ll share later this month, or early in the New Year, time and schedule permitting.\n\n<https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:920aee9c-0eff-4c23-9449-aae8c29e24d6>\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hK_H!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b78ad2f-e395-4b69-b23e-9d8e05b3866b_1024x1024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hK_H!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b78ad2f-e395-4b69-b23e-9d8e05b3866b_1024x1024.jpeg)",
