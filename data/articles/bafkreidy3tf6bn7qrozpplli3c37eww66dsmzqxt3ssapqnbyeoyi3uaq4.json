I wrote it yesterday and it’s my last article that will be looking backward at the events of this past year. From now on I’ll be focusing on 2028 and beyond._\n\n***\n\nThe full transcript was released today of Jack Smith’s behind-closed-doors deposition before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nHe spoke the words the way veterans of long wars sometimes speak of battles: plainly, without ornament, and without needing you to believe him. The former special counsel sat beneath the fluorescent lights of a Rayburn deposition room, his tie tightened as if someone had cinched it an extra notch, and he said: “We had proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” The temperature in the room did not change. No one gasped. But the sentence should have been seismic.\n\nJack Smith was describing a case that will never be tried.\n\nFor nearly three hours, Members of Congress took turns attacking him, praising him, or pretending he wasn’t there. What Smith did — and what he tried to do — somehow mattered less, in that room, than what Donald Trump thinks he deserves in return. But for anyone who still cares about the core bargain of a republic — that power is restrained by law — the transcript is a window into what nearly happened in America, and what still might.\n\nSmith, sworn in under penalty of perjury, testified that his team gathered evidence sufficient to convict a former President of the United States of federal crimes: a criminal conspiracy to overturn the results of an election, obstruction of justice, and willful retention of national defense information — the last of which rests on 18 U.S.C. § 793, the statute that has put ordinary citizens in prison for storing classified documents in their basements.\n\nHe spoke softly when he described the other crime — the one that doesn’t require a box or a fingerprint or a signed piece of paper.\n\n**“Our investigation developed proof that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.”**\n\nHe didn’t compare it to Watergate; he didn’t need to. He said it as though announcing weather.\n\nThe members sitting across from him tried to force the case back into the realm of politics, where everything is a matter of opinion and nothing can be disproven. But Smith refused the invitation.\n\nHe described a pattern — not a theory — of deliberate choices. The President was told by his own allies that he lost. When information arrived that meant he could not stay in power, he rejected it. When fringe fantasies arrived that suggested he might cling to office, he embraced them. When crowds gathered, angry and misled, he summoned them to Washington. And when those crowds breached the Capitol — on the very day the Constitution demands Congress count the votes — he did not stop them. He sent a tweet that, in Smith’s view, “endangered the life of his own Vice President.”\n\nThe room stayed still.\n\nThe deposition transcript is a document of contradictions: a prosecutor speaking with the calm of someone who knows the job is over, while describing crimes he believes — but can no longer prove — in court. The office was shut down when Donald Trump won again. The man he sought to prosecute now commands the Justice Department that would have tried him.\n\n**“The most powerful person in the world has said that Mr. Smith should be in jail,”** Smith’s lawyer said. It was not hyperbole. Trump has pledged retribution. His officials have confirmed it.\n\nThe story of what Smith uncovered is not abstract. It is not a law school hypothetical. When a Georgia Republican elector — someone who would have cast his vote for Trump — testified that the fake-elector scheme was “an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal,” that is the kind of witness prosecutors dream of. They call it “admissions against interest.” It is the opposite of politics. And Smith’s team had many like him.\n\nHe didn’t need more witnesses. He needed less time.\n\nHis team considered charging others — Giuliani, Eastman, Chesebro, Clark — the constellation orbiting the sun. Their potential exposure, under 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), was real. But the office ran out of runway. In the end, it never decided.\n\nNone of this has been adjudicated. That is both the truth and the tragedy of this record.\n\nSmith described the classified-documents case almost clinically: boxes of government secrets placed in a ballroom, then a bathroom, where club guests passed daily. 18 U.S.C. § 1519 — obstruction — requires three elements: concealment, destruction, or falsification to thwart an investigation. Smith said Trump “repeatedly tried to obstruct justice to conceal his continued retention” of those documents. He said it with the detachment of someone giving a weather forecast. But the statute, if proven, can mean up to 20 years.\n\nThere is another statute that never made it into a courtroom here — 18 U.S.C. § 1512, witness tampering. Smith said he watched as Trump unleashed statements that resulted in threats against judges, prosecutors, court staff. “If you come after me, I’ll come after you,” the former President posted. Smith did not bring this charge. But the conduct — intimidation, threats, the chilling effect on future testimony — was confirmed by multiple courts, including the D.C. Circuit. History will have to decide whether that failure to indict was restraint or fear.\n\n**“What he was not free to do,” Smith said, “was violate federal law and use knowingly false statements about election fraud to target a lawful government function.”**\n\nA lawful government function. Congress. The count.\n\nThe simplest sentence in that room might have been the most terrifying.\n\nSmith said: “These crimes were committed for his benefit.”\n\nBecause it means January 6th was never really a crowd problem. It was a command problem. A choice.\n\nThere is one more quiet detail in the transcript. It will not trend. It does not lend itself to cable-news graphics. In the middle of the interrogation about toll records — subpoenas targeting phone logs of sitting Members of Congress — Chairman Jordan read aloud an email describing the legal risk of those subpoenas. It concluded: “not to mention they’re not going to know.”\n\nSmith was pressed. Did he approve that? Yes. He did.\n\nThis is the part no one wants to sit with — because it indicts everyone.\n\nThe Constitution is not self-executing. It is not protected by reverence or nostalgia or plaques in marble hallways. It is protected — or not — by the daily choices of public servants who can say yes or no. Jack Smith, for all his certainty, could not stop the clock. Congress could not force a trial. The courts could not compel a jury. The public — the only true defendant and victim in a case like this — never got to render a verdict.\n\nWe are left, then, with testimony. With paper. With a prosecutor saying, under oath, that the system worked — and then was interrupted by the man the evidence pointed to.\n\nThe country will decide whether that interruption becomes precedent.\n\nA republic dies quietly, not because men like Jack Smith fail to speak — but because enough of us stop listening.\n\nAnd somewhere tonight, in that fluorescent-lit room now emptied of chairs and voices, the court reporter’s microphone still sits on the table, reflecting the overhead light — a single red diode staring back, waiting for someone, anyone, to press “record” again.",
