Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nThis Capital Record entry is published as a four-part series, released biweekly over the next two months. Each section stands on its own to preserve depth and clarity, with each installment approximately 2,000 words, informed by over 120 hours of cumulative research, analysis, and writing.\n\n**Part I** focuses on the business itself, the industry landscape, and recent financial performance.\n\n**Part II** will examine the balance sheet, management quality, and capital allocation.\n\n**Part III** will assess the company’s moat and defensibility, including the bull and bear cases.\n\n**Part IV** will conclude with valuation and final portfolio implications.\n\n***\n\nA few weeks ago, Warner Bros Discovery blew through my $21 price target, a highly anticipated moment, as I had been tracking the company for over two years and had been purchasing shares since it was under $7. As I saw WBD hit a 52-week high, I knew I had to start shopping for my next company. So I flipped right over to the 52-week low section of the Wall Street Journal and started looking for companies that I had heard of. Although the 52-week low section is the bargain bin of Wall Street, full of bad businesses and nearly bankrupt companies, it is possible to find a diamond in the rough.\n\nFactSet (FDS) stood out to me because I have seen it referenced so many times in news articles, quarterly reports, and other parts of the finance world. Though I didn’t know what exactly the company did, the name stuck out to me, and I began my research.\n\nFactSet was founded in 1978 by Howard E. Willie and Charles J. Snyder in New York City. William and Snyder both worked on Wall Street and, in the late 1970s, realized the industry was changing. The advent of the computer enabled information to be found much faster, and they began developing a database to provide valuable information to institutional clients. Initially, all data was delivered on paper by a bike messenger, but they quickly switched to faxed reports and eventually online delivery.\n\nThey grew quickly throughout the 80s and by 1990 had released FactSet for Windows. They expanded into Europe in 1993 and Asia in 1995. Since then, they’ve grown rapidly as a data provider, offering macroeconomic data from around the world, as well as decades of corporate earnings reports and filings.\n\nToday, they are used by more than 9000 institutional clients and 240,000 individual users. Their marquee service is the FactSet Workstation, which combines 800 data sources, including proprietary data, in-house content, and third-party providers, to distribute information up to the second. Their platform integrates with Microsoft Office products, and key integrations enable a smoother, faster workflow.\n\nFactSet is a recurring subscription business with high client retention and pricing power, driven by the value of its data and key workflow integrations. It is a reliable, long-term compounder with a defensible business, efficient capital allocation, and a high-margin service. Despite slowing top-line revenue growth, it is still an attractive investment at a reasonable price.\n\nThe company is set to continue generating attractive returns for investors and returning substantial cash through a stable, growing dividend and a recently approved billion-dollar share buyback program. Although not a flashy, high-growth technology company, they are integrating AI efficiencies across their business. They are well-positioned, with 45 years of reliable, accurate data, to benefit significantly from the boom in artificial intelligence. The company will be a reliable compounder in my portfolio, driven by continued revenue and earnings growth, and a reversion to historical discount values.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nThe business operates in three primary segments: Americas, which includes North and South America, and contributed 65% of revenue as of the end of their most recent fiscal year (FY), which was August 31. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) division contributes 25% of revenue, and the Asia Pacific (APAC) division, which contributes 10%.\n\nThe five-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for each division is roughly 10% in the Americas, 7.5% in EMEA, and 10.5% in APAC. The three-year CAGRs are 8.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. Q1 of fiscal year 2026 ended December 18, and trailing twelve-month (TTM) top-line revenue growth was 6%, 4%, and 8% for each region, resulting in revenue of 1.51 billion, 580 million, and 235 million for each respective segment.\n\nThe four primary business lines are Institutional Buyside, which provides front-office solutions such as research, order execution, and portfolio construction for asset owners and managers, as well as hedge funds. They also offer middle-office solutions, including performance tracking, attribution, reporting, risk management, and compliance.\n\nThe Dealmakers segment includes their workstations, mobile solutions, data feeds, APIs, and proprietary data for investment bankers, sell-side, analysts, corporate clients, investor relations, private equity, and venture capital firms.\n\nTheir Wealth segment is for wealth management clients. It includes workstations, book-of-business solutions, dashboards for advisors, and their key data solutions.\n\nTheir Partnerships and CGS segment provides data and text solutions, as well as their CUSIP acquisition, a key financial infrastructure component critical to the industry.\n\nA key performance metric (KPI) for the business is the annual subscription value (ASV), which is its forward-looking 12-month contractual subscription revenue from its current client contracts. If nothing happens over the next 12 months, that revenue remains intact, providing a predictable stream to reinvest or distribute to investors.\n\nPrice varies by client and the number of seats they are licensing, but their base workstation starts at $15,000, with discounts for adding more seats per client. They also offer data package upgrades and other add-ons for clients with more diverse needs. As of the end of their most recent fiscal year, they reported total revenue of 2.321 billion, up 5.4% year over year, and have a 9.2% CAGR of top-line revenue over the past five years.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s5cC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91320779-e7bd-4b94-bca0-78975cd21bb5_1483x683.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s5cC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91320779-e7bd-4b94-bca0-78975cd21bb5_1483x683.png)\n\n{{caption:5-year revenue history}}\n\n**Industry Landscape**\n\nFactSet operates in the Financial Services industry, specifically the subindustry of Exchanges & Data, a $40+ billion total addressable market (TAM) according to the company’s estimates. This market includes financial data terminals, market data feeds, index and analytics providers, credit rating agencies, and risk software. Institutional investors, wealth managers, and investment bankers have an ever-growing need for timely, accurate data and analytics, driven by market complexity, and regulatory requirements.\n\nSecular tailwinds benefiting FactSet and peers include the proliferation of data (including alternative and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data), growth in global assets under management, the growth of quantitative strategies (which demand robust analytics), and continued workflow digitization in finance. FactSet’s management has highlighted that demand for connected, high-quality data to support financial decision-making has never been more apparent, an indication that the industry’s growth will continue to be fueled by the data-intensive nature of modern investing and corporate finance.\n\nTheir key competitors include Bloomberg LP (BBGLP), S\\&P Global, LSEG, and Morningstar. Although Bloomberg LP is the leader in the space, it is a private company, so we will consider S\\&P Global and Morningstar as peer competitors in our analysis. S\\&P Global (SPGI) is a $100+ billion market cap conglomerate in financial information, with businesses including S\\&P Ratings, S\\&P Dow Jones Indices, and S\\&P Market Intelligence (which offers the Capital IQ and SNL Financial platforms).\n\nThe Capital IQ platform overlaps with FactSet in serving equity research and investment banking with fundamental data and analytics. S\\&P’s 2022 merger with IHS Markit expanded its data offerings, including fixed-income pricing and private markets data, making it an even broader competitor.\n\nSPGI’s scale and diverse data, including indices and credit ratings, give it cross-selling advantages. However, FactSet differentiates itself through superior client service and a unified platform, while S\\&P’s offerings are more siloed. Notably, FactSet serves 95 of the top 100 asset managers and \\~75% of the top 50 global investment banks.\n\nMorningstar, Inc. (MORN) is an investment research and data firm known for its mutual fund ratings and its focus on retail investors. However, it also provides institutional data through Morningstar Direct and owns PitchBook, a leading private markets data platform. Morningstar competes directly with FactSet in the Wealth segment and in data provision for asset managers. Morningstar’s PitchBook is a strong offering for private equity data, and FactSet has also expanded into this space. Compared with FactSet, Morningstar’s platform can be lower-cost and focused on fund analytics and advisor tools, and it has a significant presence among financial advisors. FactSet’s push into wealth management, like its Advisor Dashboard, is aimed directly at Morningstar’s stronghold. Both companies emphasize high data quality and strong investor-oriented research, but FactSet covers a broader swath of financial workflows.\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nThe company currently has a 32% operating margin, up from 29% three years ago, reflecting steady improvements in operating efficiency. Over the same period, net profit margin has expanded from 22% to 25%. This sustained expansion and consistency in both operating and net margins are highly attractive.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MGMc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec6fa4d7-ad46-42ac-88ac-f0db5723a044_1499x562.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MGMc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec6fa4d7-ad46-42ac-88ac-f0db5723a044_1499x562.png)\n\n{{caption:10-year operating margin}}\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MiuL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa93da4e5-e9bb-4fbd-9796-934709e19c68_1498x572.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MiuL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa93da4e5-e9bb-4fbd-9796-934709e19c68_1498x572.png)\n\n{{caption:10-year net profit margin}}\n\nAs of market close on January 2, the company’s shares traded at $286 and had a market cap of $10.6 billion. They currently have a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of approximately 18, which is significantly below their historical average of 30, and a price-to-free cash flow (FCF) ratio of 17.25, compared to a historical average of 27. This implies that the market believes the company’s future is unfavorable. As recently as December of last year, their shares were trading at a record high of $475, having dropped nearly 43% while earnings grew by over 11% in the most recent fiscal year.\n\nThe recent decline in their shares is driven by investors’ doubts about the company’s ability to navigate effectively in the age of AI, as well as a lowered full-year forecast during the September 2025 earnings call, which was reiterated on their most recent December earnings call. Management is implying more moderate revenue growth and ASV growth of just over 5%.\n\nAs of the most recent quarterly report, year-over-year (y/y) individual user count has grown by 10%, and client retention is up 0.3 to 91%. On the most recent earnings call, the company signaled increased research and development spending, as well as increased investment in upgrading technology systems. Although discouraging to see revenue growth slowing, I believe there’s a path to continued revenue growth, and that the market has significantly overreacted to a company that is, at its core, still an incredible business.\n\nWith attractive gross and net margins, an extremely high ASV retention rate of 95%, and significant pricing power from over four decades of proprietary data accumulation, the business is stronger than ever and continues to grow. Additionally, revenue growth will be found in the key APAC region, which currently provides only 10% of total revenue but is the fastest-growing, as well as in the Wealth segment, which contributes only 16% of total revenue but is the fastest-growing at over 10% in the TTM.\n\nFactSet’s earnings growth outpaced revenue growth, driven by margin expansion through management’s efficiency gains. Given the current outstanding share count of \\~37.4 million, the company also benefited from a \\~$0.45 boost to post-tax EPS from a $23M divestiture gain in FY2025. Diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025 was $15.55, up 11.8% y/y.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) measures the cash a business generates after covering its operating costs and capital expenditures. It matters to owners because this is the pool of cash available to shareholders for dividends and share buybacks, paying down debt, or reinvesting in growth.\n\nFactSet generates more cash than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings would imply due to certain non-cash expenses (like amortization of intangibles). Operating cash flow in FY2025 was $726.3 million. After capital expenditures of $108.8 million (which include capitalized software development costs and office equipment), FCF was roughly $617 million, representing an FCF yield of \\~6% on the recent $10.2B market cap. This is a healthy yield, especially compared to peers in the sector, such as SPGI’s 3.5% and MORN’s 4.6%.\n\nWorking capital is typically modest for the company, typically hovering around $150 million. In FY2025, FactSet recorded working capital outflows due to higher accounts receivable as Q4 sales grew. FactSet’s business requires low capital reinvestment; capex was only \\~4.7% of revenue in FY2025, and even that includes internal software investments to enhance future products. This low capital intensity means a large portion of EBITDA turns into free cash. Over the last 5 years, FactSet’s FCF margin has averaged \\~28% and most recently stood at 26.6%, demonstrating its ability to fund dividends and buybacks while also investing in growth.\n\n**Next:** Balance Sheet, Management Quality, and Capital Allocation.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
