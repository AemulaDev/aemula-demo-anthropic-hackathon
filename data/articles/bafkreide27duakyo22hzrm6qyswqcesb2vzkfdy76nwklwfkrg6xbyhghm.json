Same with New Jersey and other elections across the country.\n\nIt’s also hard to win when your side doesn’t show up to vote. The “other side” sure did.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7_S!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c22d2a3-833d-482f-97ec-ac9da1b3ee28_1024x1024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a7_S!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c22d2a3-833d-482f-97ec-ac9da1b3ee28_1024x1024.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Image generated by Google Gemini AI. Let’s name her Karen.}}\n\nAs political analyst and Substacker [Seth Keshel](https://www.captaink.us/p/an-election-2025-autopsy-for-your) noted, Virginia gubernatorial loser Winsome Sears lost by more than half a million votes. She trailed Donald Trump’s 2024 total—when he lost Virginia by over five percentage points—by 600,000 votes. Even Governor-elect (_shudder_) Abigail Spanberger trailed Trump’s losing 2024 tally by 100,000 votes. Worse, Sears received the fewest votes of any of the statewide candidates, and clearly dragged her running mates down with her. More about that later.\n\nIn my little House of Delegates District, [my Republican incumbent lost](https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20251104/house-30/) by a very narrow 51-49 percent margin. About 43,000 people voted, and he appears to have lost by about 600 votes. There are 71,000 registered voters in my lean-Republican district. At least my precinct came through for him. Every close race for the House of Delegates went Democratic. Democrats captured 13 previously Republican seats. The pair of precincts closest to Washington, DC, was the margin of victory for the Democrat, John McAuliffe, a progressive lefty who is just fine with boys in girls' public school locker rooms, and vice versa. He should enjoy his one-and-only term in the House of Delegates.\n\n> **I’m sure that there will be many analyses of yesterday’s elections. My 2¢ is that the biggest message is how foreign Critical Thinking is to many citizens.**\n>\n> Dr. John Droz\n\nBut it was more than a “turnout” election. It exposed what Dr. John Droz calls a failure of critical thinking on the part of so many voters, who polls suggest showed up to express their dissatisfaction with the Trump Administration and, by extension, all Republicans’ failure to address persistent unaffordability. It trumped (no pun intended) any concerns about political violence, at least in Virginia, where Democratic Attorney General-elect (shudder) won handily in a race where he was exposed for musing about placing a pair of bullets into the head of a political opponent and wishing for his kids to die in their mothers’ arms. But more about Jones later.\n\nNever mind who was primarily responsible for that unaffordability in the first place.\n\n> **Autumn Lawson, who supported Democratic candidates up and down the ticket, said she wants to see the “over taxation of Virginia stopped” and** **[said](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/voters-head-to-polls-in-first-general-election-of-trumps-second-term-5939570#MjAyNS0xMS0wNFQxNDoxOF8xODM5MDc%3D)** **state residents are being hit with high taxes on food and vehicles. She described the sales tax as “getting taxed twice.”**\n>\n> NTD News\n\nUmm, who gets to tell Autumn about which party has been at the vanguard of eliminating a double sales tax on groceries and the hated “car tax,” the nation’s highest personal property tax on vehicles? After then-Governor Jim Gilmore, almost 30 years ago, put Virginia on a path to eliminate the car tax, Virginia Democrats, led by his successor, then-Governor and now-US Senator Tim Kaine, preserved it. The annual car tax on a six-year-old Chevy Colorado pickup is over $1,000. And never mind that growing the money supply by 40 percent through a pair of very expensive laws passed during the Biden Administration sent inflation to its highest level in 40 years.\n\n[![End of the road for Virginia's car tax? Gov. Glenn Youngkin introduces bold plan](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!afKU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb6135-9904-4ba6-9f90-1f178ff65136_500x281.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!afKU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67eb6135-9904-4ba6-9f90-1f178ff65136_500x281.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Democrats said no.}}\n\nPoor Autumn, she’s not very bright or informed. But she votes, and there were a lot of people, especially young women, just like her voting (mostly by mail). Spanberger didn’t have much of a message, either, but she at least talked about affordability, as did New York City’s new Marxist Democratic Socialist Mayor, Zohran Mamdani. Is Trump, in office for less than 11 months, expected to have fixed this already? _But, “No Kings,” right_? Our public education failures of the past generation or two have really caught up with us. It’s enough to make one’s head spin.\n\nRepublicans were largely victimized by the “what have you done for me lately?” question that impatient and forgettable voters often brought with them to election season. After all, prices haven’t been going down for much of anything lately, especially the electric bill. Speaking of our ridiculous election seasons, take note:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8HRm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F862ce96d-f0e3-4ef3-acc8-d381412281cf_592x826.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8HRm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F862ce96d-f0e3-4ef3-acc8-d381412281cf_592x826.webp)\n\nThere’s no telling how many mail ballots were requested by GOP-leaning households (we don’t have voter registration by party in Virginia) and are still sitting in a pile somewhere.\n\nThere’s also the reality that candidate quality matters, and Winsome Sears didn’t cut it. Her campaign was a mess from the start, and she never gave people a reason to vote for her; it lacked a central, motivating message. I encouraged her in prior blog posts and elsewhere to please, PLEASE run on a plan to phase out the hated car tax. She mentioned getting rid of it, maybe once or twice, but never followed up. It would also have been helpful to have her run on a plan to address rapidly growing electricity bills. But no. Her campaign website was woefully devoid of issues, and she rarely raised any during her lackluster campaign appearances. She was badly outspent.\n\nHere are a few snippets from respected political observers that caught my eye and ring true:\n\n> **Republicans should be discouraged today. However, keep in mind that turnout in off-year elections almost always favors the party out of power in Washington. Republicans haven’t won the governorship of Virginia when they held the White House since 1969. Then, too, let’s keep in mind that as the Big Sort continues—that is, Republicans leaving blue states for red states in large numbers—it becomes progressively harder for Republicans to win in blue states even in good years. We saw this with Lee Zeldin in New York in 2022. If Republicans hadn’t moved out of blue states in such a high numbers, these elections would be closer—and perhaps come out differently in a few cases.**\n>\n> Dr. Steven F. Hayward, Hoover Institute Fellow and Presidential Historian\n>\n> [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_RSB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa960ae13-05d9-43df-9a42-2bcdbdc9e9d4_1456x969.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_RSB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa960ae13-05d9-43df-9a42-2bcdbdc9e9d4_1456x969.webp)\n\n> **In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the gubernatorial election by 15 points, while in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill prevailed by 13 points — a nine point and seven point improvement, respectively, over Vice President Kamala Harris’ showing in those states last year.**\n>\n> **Democrats’ success in both states was driven by the unpopularity of the president and many of his policies, as well as an overall dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. In both New Jersey and Virginia, more than 60% of voters said they were angry or dissatisfied about “the way things are going in the U.S.” with Sherrill and Spanberger each capturing more than three-quarters of those dissatisfied voters.**\n>\n> Amy Walter and others at the _Cook Political Report_\n\n> **When I was a kid throwing a fit about my team not winning, my Dad would remind me, “the other side wants to win, too.” Nothing can be truer in an off-year environment one year after Trump won the 2024 elections. They have been chomping at the bit to get to the polls to register their animosity with the administration. Polling is less important than historical precedent, which carries great weight in my predictive analysis.**\n>\n> **Trump Derangement Syndrome is real, and in blue states, can still carry the day. Earle-Sears is currently over 600,000 votes** _**behind**_ **Trump’s losing total from the 2024 presidential election, and Spanberger trails Trump’s 2024 total by over 100,000, with voting nearly complete. It is hard to win when your side doesn’t show up.**\n>\n> Seth Keshel\n\nIn both New Jersey and Virginia, minority voters who had been trending Republican (at least with Trump on the ballot) snapped back into the Democratic coalition—at least this year. But Trump also will never be on the ballot again. Having an “R” after your name is clearly not enough, a lesson that should have been learned after the disappointing 2022 midterm elections. That should be a primary focus for GOP professionals following Tuesday’s resounding defeats. Trump and his political organization also did remarkably little to generate support for the GOP tickets in Virginia and New Jersey. I’m not sure it would have mattered, frankly.\n\nWhat are some other lessons going forward, and what might this foretell for the upcoming 2026 midterm elections?\n\nFirst, _candidate quality matters_, and clearly, Winsome Sears lacked it. She’s a fine person and is a terrific public servant, but as noted above and previously, her campaign failed to either persuade or motivate voters. That was not the case with Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey, who, from all accounts, ran a terrific campaign and was not as badly outspent as Sears, thanks to public financing with spending limits in Garden State elections.\n\nSecond, it matters for the midterms, just as the 2009 off-year romps by Republicans in both Virginia and New Jersey pre-staged the GOP takeover of Congress in the 2010 elections. It bodes poorly for GOP candidates for Congress and the Senate unless something changes. It will certainly hurt fundraising and candidate recruitment, which are still ongoing. Alarm bells are going off at the headquarters of all three national Republican party committees and those of candidates in target races.\n\nThird, the redistricting wars are just getting more interesting — and more optimistic — for Democrats. Thanks to California’s Proposition 50, about 4-5 GOP House members are about to lose their seats. Virginia Democrats will now get a new Attorney General’s ruling and proceed to redistrict 2-3 GOP House members out of their districts in time for the 2026 elections, although it will require statewide voter approval. The GOP can match that, but with only a slim 3-5-vote margin in the US House and given the history of mid-term elections, it looks forbidding.\n\nFourth, the election ultimately won’t affect long-term trends. Democrats, especially progressives, will now be in charge in places like New York City, and crazy policies are coming to Virginia. Spanberger has promised to sign legislation to create a Colorado-style retail Cannabis market in the Old Dominion, and I wonder how my local town of 10,000 people is going to respond to having weed shops on every corner. There’s no realistic plan from Democrats to make things more affordable in Virginia.\n\nIn fact, Democrats in Virginia and, probably, New Jersey will continue to embrace California-style energy policies that are guaranteed to send utility bills skyrocketing even further. The last time Democrats were entirely in charge of Virginia, they enacted laws to comply with California Air Resources Board regulations, including a ban on the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Spanberger is also likely to drop outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s efforts to build small modular nuclear plants in Virginia to meet our growing energy needs for a grid that’s already maxed out, with hundreds more energy hogging data centers to be built. Lefty progressives don’t like nuclear power any more than they like coal-powered plants.\n\n[![Retro Style Travel Poster, West Virginia Vintage Rustic Poster Print, Home Wall Art, Office Wall Decor, West Virginia State Map Poster](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!icoN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00413bf0-9ccf-48a4-a8b0-175d2a882355_500x500.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!icoN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00413bf0-9ccf-48a4-a8b0-175d2a882355_500x500.jpeg)\n\nIf there’s a winner in this election, it is the State of West Virginia. Thanks to explosive growth in the Mountaineer States’ nearby panhandle, their low-tax, pro-growth policies and better affordability are likely to attract more refugees from Virginia and nearby Maryland. [It’s already happening](https://www.journal-news.net/journal-news/eastern-panhandle-counties-among-only-growing-in-west-virginia/article_6f54e219-4427-5242-9399-bb89a88b82b3.html). GOP State legislators from western Maryland’s counties and officials in Virginia’s Frederick County, atop the Shenandoah Valley, have previously announced support for joining West Virginia. Gov. Pat Morrissey, a Republican, is grinning ear to ear today. The state is already on a path to reduce and eliminate its income tax, and its property taxes are already _way lower_ than those of its neighbors.\n\nWest Virginia has a car tax, too, but they get [a dollar-for-dollar state income tax credit](https://www.wtrf.com/west-virginia/west-virginia-motor-vehicle-property-tax-credit-is-now-a-law/) for it. And legislation is pending to get rid of it altogether. Republicans have super majorities in West Virginia’s legislature and control all six statewide elected positions. _Heart be still_. Maybe I should invest in a car dealership in neighboring Jefferson County, West Virginia.\n\nIf you’re looking to sell a home in northern New Jersey or southern Connecticut, outside New York City, this would be a good time. Reports of bidding wars from people fleeing Comrade Mamdani’s New York are growing.\n\nBack to our new Virginia Attorney General, Jay Jones. He has an interesting problem. It was revealed during the campaign that he not only mused about putting two bullets into the head of a Republican political opponent, then House Speaker Todd Gilbert, but also about watching Gilbert’s two sons die in his wife’s arms. He mused about how dead cops would at least kill fewer people. This is Virginia’s new chief law enforcement official (to be). The Republican Delegate to whom Jones’ texted his musings, Carrie Coyner, was rewarded by losing her election on Tuesday.\n\nBut that’s not all. It also came out in early October that as part of a reckless driving charge - driving 116 mph in a 70 mph zone on I-64 - he was supposed to conduct 1,000 hours of “community service.” [Virginia law clearly defines](https://www.vacourts.gov/static/courts/circuit/Waynesboro/costs_and_fines_csp.pdf) what qualifies as “community service.” Jones passed off 500 hours of “community services” for his political action committee, which doesn’t qualify. He’s violated the terms of his court settlement, [which is now being investigated](https://wjla.com/news/local/special-prosecutor-jay-jones-reckless-driving-community-service-investigation-virginia-politics-new-kent-county-political-pac-nonpolitical-attorney-lawyer-lawsuit) by a New Kent County special prosecutor.\n\nJones might wind up serving jail time for his violation. After all, no one is above the law, _right_?\n\nFinal words from Washington, DC’s, WMAL-AM radio talker Larry O’Connor:\n\n> **Relax. Your Democrat neighbor doesn’t actually want you dead. They still wave politely when you’re both dragging the trash cans to the curb, and they’ll still accept a plate of your wife’s Christmas cookies (with the customary passive-aggressive “Oh, I shouldn’t…”). But yesterday’s Virginia election results confirmed something far more honest, and therefore far more disturbing: while they don’t want you dead, they have absolutely no problem voting for a politician who thinks your worldview is a public health hazard requiring government intervention.**\n>\n> **So no, your Democrat neighbors don’t want you dead.**\n>\n> **They just want you regulated, silenced, surveilled, investigated, and ideally removed from polite society… but with compostable handcuffs and an equity-based sentencing calculator.**\n>\n> **Call it progress.**\n>\n> **Republicans will write op-eds about it. Democrats will write subpoenas.**\n>\n> **And your neighbor? They’ll smile at you over the hedge while voting for the guy who thinks your lawn sign is a threat to democracy.**",
