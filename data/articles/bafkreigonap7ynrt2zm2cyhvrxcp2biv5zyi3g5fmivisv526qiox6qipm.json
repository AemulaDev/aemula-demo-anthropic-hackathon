  "body": "Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed* is one of the few books I've ever read that I haven't been able to put down. What drove me to keep reading? It wasn't enjoyment or agreement. It was extreme frustration.\n\nThe book came out in 2018 amidst a growing wave of populist discontent, but its relevance has only grown as the viability of liberal democracy has continued to be called into question over the past seven years. Arguably, no book has had a bigger impact on the discussion around the future of liberalism than this book.\n\nIt came out a year after Trump first took office, and it succinctly articulated why the Reagan/Bush conservative coalition had fractured. Popular discontent with Bush's [compassionate conservatism](https://www.hoover.org/research/what-compassionate-conservatism-and-not) and the perceived failures of Reagan's [fusionist coalition](https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/the-conservative-consensus-frank-meyer-barry-goldwater-and-the-politics) led to a backlash on the right, and Patrick Deneen's ability to articulate the grievances of that backlash earned him a fast pass to the top of the [\"reactionary moment\"](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect-podcast/386100/2024-election-trump-republican-party-reactionary).\n\nLed by Deneen and other similar thinkers, the new reactionary right published its unofficial manifesto in the 2019 *First Things* article, [\"Against the Dead Consensus\"](https://firstthings.com/against-the-dead-consensus/), which celebrated the death of pre-Trump conservatism and the rise of a newer, more reactionary, and more illiberal strain of right-wing thought.\n\nMany of the guiding grievances and principles of the new right stem from Deneen's thought, so *Why Liberalism Failed* is an excellent place to start when thinking about the seismic political shifts that have occurred globally since 2016. In many ways, how one reacts to this book is a good indication of where one sits in today's quickly evolving political discourse.\n\n### A Quick Summary\n\n\"Liberalism has failed-not because it fell short, but because it was true to itself. It has failed because it has succeeded\"\n\nIn short, *Why Liberalism Failed* argues that liberalism, defined as the broad political tent that contains both the American left and the American right, has been a victim of its own success. Crucially, Deneen argues that this success-begets-failure arc was *inevitable* given the philosophical underpinnings of liberalism. According to Deneen, liberalism was always eventually going to produce atomized individuals, broken communities, and a vacuous culture due to its own internal contradictions.\n\nUniquely, Deneen argues not against a specific form of liberalism, say New Deal liberalism or Neoliberalism, but instead argues that the entire liberal experiment beginning with the founding was a mistake, based on faulty assumptions about human nature and the supposed benefits of individualism.\n\nNotably, many of the societal issues Deneen lays at the feet of liberalism have traditionally been issues championed by the left, such as wealth inequality, corporatism, and campaign finance, to name just a few. Of course, he laments many pet issues of the right as well, such as declines in civic participation, the disruption of traditional familial and religious structures, and the corrupting influence of academia.\n\nFor Deneen, the core liberal ideals of individual autonomy, self-invention, and liberation from tradition have gradually eroded the very social fabric that once supported a flourishing civic life. Over time, liberalism undermined communities, weakened institutions, and replaced a shared moral horizon with personal preference and rampant relativism.\n\nUltimately, Deneen's lightly sketched solution is a return to localism, virtue ethics, and the cultivation of virtuous citizens who are not subject to the corrupting influence of individualism.\n\nIf Deneen is right, then the entirety of the American experiment since its founding has been an inevitable mistake. For both moderate conservatives and moderate liberals, being able to understand and effectively respond to Deneen's critiques is necessary for the defense of liberal democracy. In this series, I'll outline my three main criticisms of the book.\n\nFirst, we'll look at Deneen's sloppy oversimplification of liberalism.\n\n### What is Liberalism?\n\nDeneen's definition of liberalism is a vast oversimplification, and this strawman liberalism is what allows Deneen to dismiss liberalism in whole, rather than in part.\n\nWhereas a more nuanced approach would have targeted the specific form of liberalism he has an issue with, Deneen's monolithic oversimplification gives him the ability to make a much bigger splash by dismissing the whole liberal project outright. So, how does Deneen oversimply liberalism?\n\nDeneen's liberalism is a unified Enlightenment ideology created in a vacuum by John Locke. This liberalism elevates the autonomous individual above all else. From this starting point, Deneen draws a straight line to the modern cult of the individual and claims that the seeds of liberalism's demise were sown at its outset.\n\nThe problem is, liberalism's roots are [rich, varied, and much more complex](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/p/will-the-real-liberalism-please-stand) than Deneen admits. In addition to Locke, American liberalism has been shaped by republicanism, communitarian virtue ethics, Protestant moral theology, utilitarians, Rawlsians, and many others.\n\nIn fact, much of what Deneen ultimately proposes as an alternative to liberalism is a sort of micro-scale communitarianism focused on the cultivation of virtuous citizens who feel a duty to the local community.\n\nThis classical *polis*-style republicanism, however, is exactly what many of the founding fathers meant when referring to liberalism in the first place. Rather than the natural rights Enlightenment liberalism of John Locke, many founders instead understood liberalism to be the [republican liberalism](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/liberalism-is-not-enough) of Aristotle.\n\nThese two competing definitions of liberalism - one Lockean, one Aristotelian - both contributed meaningfully to the founder's conception of the American liberal tradition. In fact, the liberalism that de Tocqueville commended during his time in New England more closely resembled Deneen's republicanism than the pluralistic commercialism of 19th century New York City.\n\nLiberalism has a more varied lineage than Deneen gives it credit for. His oversimplification of liberalism obscures an obvious issue with his argument - liberalism's flexibility and various historical antecedents means that whatever problems modern liberalism has caused could have been avoided had we prioritized a different strain of liberalism.\n\nWith a correct broad tent view of liberalism in mind, the more accurate title of his book should have been, \"Why the specific form of Lockean liberalism most popular today failed\", but of course, that's not as punchy, so Deneen opted instead for the dramatic oversimplification.\n\nLiberalism's competing lineages highlight one of its core strengths: its flexibility and ability to evolve over time. While many of the criticisms of modern liberalism that Deneen raises may be valid, his conclusion that liberalism in whole is to blame does not follow.\n\nI'll explore my second and third critique in Part II.\n\n***\n\n*To read more and support or subscribe directly, find all of [Travis Monteleone's work on Substack](https://travismonteleone.substack.com/).*",
