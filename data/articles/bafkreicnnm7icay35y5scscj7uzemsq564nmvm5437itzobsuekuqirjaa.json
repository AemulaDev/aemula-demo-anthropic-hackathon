  "body": "[Watch Episode](https://wilkwilkinson.substack.com/p/the-conversation-before-the-conversation)\n\nIn a culture addicted to outrage and speed, **what if the real work of change starts by slowing down and listening?**\n\nIn this episode of _Derate The Hate_, I sit down with **Malka Kopell** and **Palma Joy Strand**, co-founders of **Civity**, to explore how **relationships — not rhetoric — are the foundation of healthy communities**.\n\nMalka and Palma bring decades of experience from law, mediation, community organizing, philanthropy, and civic engagement. But what makes this conversation powerful isn’t credentials — it’s clarity.\n\n### 🔑 What We Explore in This Episode\n\n✔️ Why trust in institutions is collapsing — and what can replace it\n\n✔️ How storytelling creates empathy without requiring agreement\n\n✔️ The difference between conflict resolution and relationship building\n\n✔️ What courageous citizenship looks like in everyday life\n\n✔️ Why “the conversation before the conversation” changes everything\n\n✔️ How small actions — a smile, a question, a moment of listening — rebuild civic muscle\n\n### 🧠 A Core Insight\n\n> **Two people in genuine conversation become the nucleus of a “we.”**\n\nThis episode isn’t about fixing the country overnight.\nIt’s about **reclaiming agency**, restoring dignity, and remembering that communities don’t heal through policies alone — they heal through people.\n\n### 🌱 Take Action\n\nCivity offers free, practical tools anyone can use to begin rebuilding trust and connection in their own community:\n\n👉 Visit:\n\n<https://www.civity.org>\n\n👉 Explore their DIY resources and conversation practices\n\nIf you’ve ever felt powerless, disconnected, or unsure how to help — this conversation offers a place to start.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-r2o!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b980d22-0ad0-427c-ab9c-e68484b1c941_1200x630.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-r2o!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b980d22-0ad0-427c-ab9c-e68484b1c941_1200x630.png)\n\nThe world is a better place if we are better people.
