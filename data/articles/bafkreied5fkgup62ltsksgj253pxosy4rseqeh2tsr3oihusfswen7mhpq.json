  "body": "One of the patterns that shows up again and again in divided societies is this:\npeople don’t just disagree — they begin living in entirely different realities.\n\nIn this short clip from my conversation with conflict-resolution practitioner **Nathan Stock**, he explains how political tribes form around separate media ecosystems. Over time, those ecosystems don’t just inform opinions — they shape how people interpret the world, who they trust, and how they view those on the “other side.”\n\nWhat struck me most about this insight is how ordinary it feels.\nNo one wakes up intending to dehumanize their neighbors. But when our media diets constantly reinforce threat, suspicion, or contempt, perception quietly becomes reality.\n\nThat’s why slowing down, widening our information sources, and staying in relationship across differences isn’t abstract work — it’s practical, everyday civic maintenance.\n\n▶️ _Short clip below\\._\n\n[Watch Clip](https://wilkwilkinson.substack.com/p/different-media-different-realities)\n\n**I’m curious:**\nDo you feel like Americans are increasingly living in different informational realities?\nWhere do you notice that most — online, in your community, or in your own media habits?",
