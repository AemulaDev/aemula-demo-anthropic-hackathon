  "body": "Welcome to the AWM Financial Newsletter! Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\n_This builds directly on_ [Part I](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/factset-a-high-quality-business-at?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, which covers the business, industry, and financial performance._\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nFactSet’s balance sheet is strong and conservatively managed. At the end of their most recent fiscal year, they had $337 million in cash and cash equivalents and $17 million in short-term investments, for a total cash balance of $354 million. Their liquidity is strong, with a current ratio of 1.4, indicating a strong ability to repay debt. Their five-year average current ratio is 2.13, and after recent acquisitions, liquidity has decreased, though not meaningfully.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oKrZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b57eafd-e825-4aaa-9431-b80325e0b682_1471x620.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oKrZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b57eafd-e825-4aaa-9431-b80325e0b682_1471x620.png)\n\n{{caption:5-year current ratio}}\n\nThey maintain a relatively light debt load with no debt maturing until 2027. They currently have two outstanding fixed-rate senior notes of $500 million each; the first is due in 2027 and has a coupon rate of 2.9% and the second is due in 2032 with a coupon rate of 3.45%. Both of these senior notes are callable at 101% of face value. Still, at such low interest rates, which are both currently below the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), they should be in no rush to repay.\n\nAdditionally, they have a term facility revolving loan agreement that matures on April 20, 28, that has a principal payment due quarterly of 1.25% and is not subject to any other mandatory repayments. They may repay the full amount of the facility with no premium or penalty before the maturity date. During fiscal 2025, the company repaid $125 million under the 2025 term facility, including roughly $69 million to satisfy scheduled quarterly repayments and voluntarily prepay another $56 million.\n\nThe company also has a revolving credit facility that matures in April 2030, which provides $100 million in letters of credit and $100 million in swing line loans, with additional commitments of up to $1 billion available. Their cost for the credit facilities is the SOFR +.975%, which includes a .1% credit spread adjustment.\n\nWith FY2025 free cash flow sufficient to cover interest expense by roughly 11×, FactSet maintains a substantial margin of safety around its debt servicing capacity. Annual interest expense of approximately $56M is well supported by recurring free cash flow of over $615M, providing ample cushion even under higher-rate scenarios for the company’s floating-rate debt. Low fixed-rate debt, locked in through 2027 and 2032, further limits refinancing risk.\n\nA notable aspect of the balance sheet is that of the $4.3B in assets, $1.916 is Intangible assets (net), and $1.285 is Goodwill. Combined, intangibles and Goodwill are \\~$3.20B, which is \\~75% of total assets and about 146% of equity. These intangibles, most recently stemming from the CUSIP acquisition, include customer relationships, databases, software, and trademarks. While high intangibles can signal risk of impairment, in FactSet’s case, these are core to its business value. For example, CUSIP’s value, recorded as an intangible asset, is supported by a steady stream of licensing fees, making impairment unlikely given its essential role in the financial industry.\n\nNonetheless, investors should be aware that a large portion of FactSet’s book value is tied to acquired intangibles that must be amortized over time, and amortization was $73M in FY2025. Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of net assets in acquisitions; it’s an indicator of the strategic value expected from those deals. No goodwill impairments have been noted, implying acquisitions are performing as expected.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3_AL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffafa5a59-6645-473e-b620-144f3be24eaf_1263x343.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3_AL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffafa5a59-6645-473e-b620-144f3be24eaf_1263x343.png)\n\n{{caption:5-year amortization schedule}}\n\nThe LiquidityBook acquisition added $77.8M of amortizable intangible assets, primarily consisting of software technology ($65.6M, 12-year life), client relationships ($8.8M, 17-year life), and trade names ($3.4M, 10-year life), all amortized on a straight-line basis, meaning costs are spread out across the asset’s useful life.\n\nThese assets carry weighted-average lives skewed toward the medium- to long-term, with client relationships representing the longest-dated component at 17 years. The transaction also generated $164.8M of Goodwill, which is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment annually. The amortization profile is therefore front-loaded toward software technology, with predictable, evenly distributed expenses over the next decade.\n\nA separate acquisition for Irwin in fiscal year 2024 contributed $39.2M of amortizable intangibles, including software technology ($36.1M, 12-year life), client relationships ($1.7M, 11-year life), and trade names ($1.4M, 10-year life), all amortized on a straight-line basis. Similar to the LiquidityBook transaction, this acquisition is more heavily weighted toward software technology, but has a shorter weighted-average maturity. Associated Goodwill totaled $91.4M. Overall, amortization from this deal is steady and predictable, with no near-term maturity cliffs.\n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (PPE), and leasehold improvements totaled $230.1M gross as of August 31, 2025, offset by $144.9 of accumulated depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net carrying value of $85.2M. The asset base is diversified across leasehold improvements ($101.4M), computer equipment ($97.9M), and furniture and fixtures ($30.8M).\n\nAnnual depreciation and amortization expense related to PPE was $24.1M in FY2025, reflecting a mature asset base with consistent reinvestment. Amortization here is operational in nature and closely aligned with ongoing CapEx requirements rather than acquisition activity.\n\nTotal Goodwill increased to $1.285B as of August 31, 2025, driven primarily by $260.8M of acquisitions, partially offset by minor divestitures and currency translation effects. Goodwill is allocated predominantly to the Americas ($925.8) and EMEA ($344.4) segments, with minimal exposure to Asia Pacific. As Goodwill is not amortized, its economic impact is evaluated through impairment testing rather than scheduled expense recognition.\n\nTotal identifiable intangible assets as of August 31, 2025, had a gross value of $2.47B, with $552.6 in accumulated amortization, resulting in a net carrying amount of $1.92B. The largest categories include Amortizable Business Acquisition (ABA) business process intangibles ($1.58B gross, 36-year life), client relationships ($280.1 gross, 11–26 years), developed technology ($260.2 gross, 3–5 years), and software technology ($253.9 gross, 3–12 years).\n\nShorter-dated assets, such as developed technology and software technology, drive a higher proportion of near-term amortization expense. While ABA processes and client relationships extend amortization well into the long term. Overall, the amortization schedule is well laddered, with no single maturity concentration dominating future expense.\n\nFactSet expects to recognize $1.9 billion in total future amortization expense beginning in fiscal 2026 and extending beyond 2030. The projected annual expense ramps down over time, starting at $143M in 2026, then $118M in 2027, $90M in 2028, $73M in 2029, and $70M in 2030, with a substantial $1.4B in amortization scheduled for the years thereafter.\n\nDebt-to-equity (D/E) is a leverage ratio that measures how much a company relies on borrowed funds relative to shareholders’ equity to finance its assets and operations. FactSet’s average debt-to-equity ratio over the last five years is 1.34, and it is currently just under 1. In comparison, SPGI and MORN have five-year averages of 6.46 and 1.36, respectively. However, SPGI has dropped as low as 0.8 over the last few years. Additionally, their current ratios are 0.85 and 1.05, indicating higher debt loads and less liquidity than FactSet.\n\nOverall, FactSet’s balance sheet shows financial flexibility. Debt is modest relative to earnings power, and cash plus ongoing cash generation efficiently covers obligations. There is no liquidity or solvency concern; the company could carry more debt given its stable cash flows, as many peers do. However, FactSet’s prudent approach provides a buffer against unforeseen events and maintains capacity for acquisitions.\n\nManagement & Capital Allocation\n\nPhil Snow was the long-tenured leader who essentially built modern FactSet from the inside out. He joined FactSet in 1996, rising through international and sales leadership roles in Tokyo, Sydney, and the US before becoming President and then CEO in 2015. Over his roughly 10-year run as CEO and 30-year career overall, he oversaw a period of doubling revenue and consistent double-digit EPS growth, while broadening FactSet’s global footprint and product stack and maintaining high client retention.\n\nSnow’s leadership was defined by disciplined growth and execution rather than flashy storytelling, and he has well-positioned the company for its next phase in the AI revolution. He retired as CEO in September 2025, transitioning to a senior advisor role until the end of 2025 to support the handover to the new CEO.\n\nFactSet’s management team includes several long‑tenured executives who have been with the company for many years, providing continuity in strategy and culture. The new CEO, Sanoke Viswanathan, previously spent about 15 years at JPMorgan Chase in senior roles, including as CEO of International Consumer and Wealth Management and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, bringing significant experience in global finance and technology‑driven growth, but is new to FactSet.\n\nManagement has demonstrated efficient resource allocation, with an average return on equity of 41% over the past 10 years and a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 33%. However, since 2022, it has stabilized at 20%. The post-2022 decline in ROIC primarily reflects a step-up in invested capital following the significant acquisition of CUSIP Global Services for $1.925B, rather than deterioration in underlying business economics, with current ROIC levels still well above the company’s cost of capital and consistent with a digestion phase rather than value destruction.\n\nCompared to their peers, SPGI has an ROIC of 7.3%, while MORN has an ROIC of 10.4%. FactSet’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is currently 8.3% compared to SPGI’s 10.6% and MORN’s 9.75%. Giving them a healthy spread of 7.25, compared to -3.2 and .64.\n\nFactSet’s executive compensation program is structured to align management’s interests with long-term shareholder value. According to the 2025 Proxy’s Compensation Discussion & Analysis, a significant portion of named executive officers’ pay is performance-based.\n\nSpecifically, annual bonuses are tied to achieving targets for metrics such as organic ASV growth and adjusted operating earnings growth. Long-term incentives are granted in the form of equity, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) and stock options. These PRSUs vest based on multi-year performance metrics, which include cumulative EPS growth. The CEO’s pay ratio and the transparency in the Proxy indicate a robust governance process around pay.\n\nNotably, FactSet has a Recoupment (clawback) policy in place for incentive compensation, as required by recent regulations, meaning that if results are restated or misconduct occurs, bonuses can be clawed back, thereby protecting shareholders.\n\nFrom an alignment perspective, it’s encouraging that FactSet’s executives and directors hold meaningful equity stakes (founder Howard Wille and other insiders have historically held stock, though founder involvement is now minimal as they’ve retired). Sanoke Viswanathan’s contract is built around equity: a $22M performance-vesting stock option grant for FY26–27 and an ongoing $11M annual equity target starting FY28. He also receives roughly $36M in make-whole RSUs/PSUs to replace awards forfeited at JPMorgan, tightly aligning his upside with FactSet’s long-term stock performance.\n\nThe Board is also newly refreshed, with four directors joining since 2022, bringing fresh oversight. I will monitor how Viswanathan’s leadership unfolds, but the continuity in the CFO and others provides stability.\n\nFactSet’s culture has traditionally been client-focused and collaborative. It consistently scores well in employee satisfaction surveys and is known for promoting from within. Phil Snow was a long-time FactSetter who rose to CEO. The transition to external leadership could infuse new ideas, but maintaining FactSet’s strong culture of customer service and innovation will be essential.\n\nGovernance-wise, the company has split the Chairman/CEO roles in the past, with Phil Hadley serving as Chairman even after stepping down as CEO until recently. The 2025 Proxy indicates there’s an independent Chair or lead director, and all directors except the CEO are independent. The Board committees, including Audit, Compensation, and Nominating, are entirely independent. Shareholders get a vote on say-on-pay (an advisory vote on exec comp). The company is amending its charter to eliminate supermajority requirements for specific actions (a shareholder-friendly move up for a vote in Proposal 6 in 2025).\n\nFactSet’s leadership appears capable and aligned with shareholders. The new CEO has strong credentials, and the incentive structure encourages the management team to drive profitable growth as they win when shareholders win. The leadership transition is a point to watch and a key risk going forward, as execution under new stewardship needs to be proven.\n\nSo far, guidance has been reaffirmed, and the continuity strategy has been clearly communicated. If Viswanathan can successfully lead FactSet through the next phase of AI integration and expanding TAM capture, while maintaining the customer-centric ethos, the company will continue to flourish. The Board’s mix of tech and finance experts provides a good sounding board for any transformative initiatives.\n\n**Next:** Moat & Defensibility and the Bull and Bear Case\n\n*Got questions, disagreements, or a money topic you want broken down next?*\n\n*Shoot me an email at Crawford\\@awmfinancial.net or visit awmfinancial.net.*\n\n*This content is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.
