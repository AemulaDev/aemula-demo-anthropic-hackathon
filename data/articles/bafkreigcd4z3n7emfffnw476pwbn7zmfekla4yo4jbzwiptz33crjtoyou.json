Outside, a flag snapped against its halyard in a February wind. Inside, the line shuffled forward, coats draped over arms, phones tucked back into pockets as people prepared to be processed.\n\nThe form had already been filled out — name, date of birth, place of birth, sex. The applicant hesitated for half a second, then checked the box that matched the marker they had carried on every federal document for years.\n\nThe clerk typed, paused, and frowned.\n\n“That option isn’t available anymore,” she said gently.\n\nShe turned the screen just enough for the applicant to see. The field had changed.\n\nThere had been no notice in the mail, no hearing anyone remembered, no explanation taped to the glass. Somewhere, between a federal judge’s injunction and a future court decision that might not come for months, the government had been given permission to act — not because it had prevailed on the law, but because it had asked for a stay.¹\n\nThe passport would be issued. The marker would change. And the policy’s legality would remain unsettled.\n\nRights, in this version of America, would exist only after you survived the interim.\n\nThe policy itself was blunt. New passports would list only an applicant’s “biological sex at birth,” eliminating the “X” marker and barring transgender Americans from retaining the designation they had long used.² In October, a district judge blocked the rule, finding it likely unlawful and ordering the government to stop.³\n\nInstead, the Supreme Court lifted it.⁴\n\nThe order arrived without oral argument and with only a few spare paragraphs of explanation, granting the government permission to enforce the rule while the litigation continued. The Court called it a stay.⁵\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson called it something else.\n\nIn dissent, she wrote that the Court had “once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate — or, really, any — justification.”⁶\n\nIt was a dissent. In tone, it sounded more like a warning than a legal objection.\n\nThis was not, in Jackson’s telling, a dispute about transgender rights alone. It was about something more technical, and more dangerous: what happens when courts stop deciding law and start deciding timing, when justice becomes something you receive only after living under the policy first.\n\nEmergency stays have always existed. Courts pause enforcement while cases move forward, preserving order until appeals are resolved. What has changed is how often, and how consequentially, the Supreme Court now uses that power. In recent years, its emergency docket — unsigned orders, minimal reasoning, no argument — has become a fast lane for government action. These rulings are temporary, but they increasingly determine who must comply immediately and who is allowed to wait.⁷\n\nThe Constitution, Jackson is suggesting, has quietly acquired a waiting period.⁸\n\nEarlier this year, in a dispute over public-health funding, Jackson accused the Court of abandoning its own standards. The administration had asked to resume canceling NIH grants while litigation continued. A lower court blocked the move. The Supreme Court lifted that block, allowing the cancellations to proceed before any appellate court ruled on legality.⁹\n\nJackson dissented and reached for language meant to travel–like a fictional game from the _[Calvin and Hobbes](https://www.google.com/search?q=Calvin+and+Hobbes\\&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS516US516\\&oq=calvinball\\&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDAgAEEUYORixAxiABDIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDIxMDJqMGo3qAIAsAIA\\&sourceid=chrome\\&ie=UTF-8\\&ved=2ahUKEwjwnpSX7qGSAxUJElkFHUYFATIQgK4QegQIARAE)_ comic strip.\n\n**“Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules,”** she wrote.¹⁰\n\nIt was an extraordinary line for a sitting justice, not because it was partisan, but because it was institutional. Her concern was not about which administration prevailed. It was about method — about a Court increasingly willing to alter standards depending on posture and urgency. Interim relief, she argued, had become a way to govern without saying so, by deciding who must live under contested law.¹¹\n\nThis pattern is not confined to one administration or one ideology. Emergency orders have sometimes restrained executive action as well. The structural concern Jackson raises is regime-agnostic. It is not who benefits, but what kind of power the Court is normalizing.¹²\n\nIf the government ultimately loses, the policy can always be withdrawn. But the people who lived under it do not get those months back. Patients denied care do not recover lost treatment. Workers sent home do not reclaim vanished wages. Applicants forced to accept altered documents do not erase the fact that they were compelled to carry them.\n\n**“Pointless but painful,”** she called it.¹³\n\nBy now, the pattern is familiar. A district judge blocks a policy. The government files an emergency appeal. The Supreme Court lifts the block. The policy takes effect. Months pass. The final ruling arrives in a country already shaped by the interim.¹⁴\n\nAmerican history is crowded with examples of rights delayed becoming rights denied, in form if not in scale. After _Brown v. Board of Education_, desegregation proceeded under the promise of **“all deliberate speed,”** a phrase that soon became permission to wait. Courts had spoken. The law was settled. But children still stood outside segregated classrooms for years.¹⁵\n\nDelay, then as now, became a decision.\n\nThe Court today describes its emergency interventions as prudent. Jackson calls them abdication. And the judges who were asked to slow executive power are discovering that the work is becoming more exposed.\n\nIn July, Reuters reported a rise in swatting calls, bomb threats, and other acts of intimidation aimed at federal judges.¹⁶ Esther Salas, whose son was murdered by a litigant who came to her door, described the campaign not as personal terror but as institutional danger.¹⁷\n\n**“This is a real threat to democracy and judicial independence,”** she said.¹⁸\n\nEmergency stays do not cause intimidation. But both arise from the same pressures: accelerating executive power, thinning procedural buffers, and a growing asymmetry between those who act quickly and those asked to restrain them.¹⁹ Executive action moves faster. Trial judges hesitate — or require uncommon resolve — to slow anything down.\n\nInto that narrowing channel flows Jackson’s fear: that the only protection left will be a final ruling that arrives after the moment when protection mattered.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts speaks of legitimacy. Justice Elena Kagan warns that orders must be obeyed.²⁰ Jackson’s warning is quieter and sharper. She is not worried that the public will abandon the Court. She is worried that the Court itself is teaching the country a new habit — that law arrives after endurance, that rights are provisional, that power moves first, and judgment follows later, if it follows at all.\n\nIn the passport case, the merits will eventually be decided. The policy may fall. The injunction may be restored.\n\nBut the applicant at the counter will not return to that February morning. They cannot unsee the changed field on the screen. They will not uncarry the document they were forced to accept.\n\nWhat the Court allowed to happen in the meantime will remain part of the record.\n\nThis is the transformation Jackson is trying to make visible. Not spectacle, not decree, not crisis. Just timing — orders that decide little and change much. A Court that increasingly governs by when rather than what.²¹\n\nAnd when, as constitutional history keeps reminding us, often determines who receives the benefit of the law and who is asked to wait until it no longer matters.²²\n\n⸻\n\n**Biibliography**\n\n1\\.
