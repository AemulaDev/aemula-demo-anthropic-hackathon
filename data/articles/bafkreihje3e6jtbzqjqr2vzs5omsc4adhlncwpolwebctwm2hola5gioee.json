The apartment is still, save for the buzz of a ceiling fan slicing the thick San Salvador air. Carlos Martínez sits up, not fully awake, but alert in a way his body has learned over time. It’s the third time this month.\n\nLater, forensic analysts at Citizen Lab will confirm it was Pegasus. Not a phishing link. Not a tap mistake. A zero-click exploit that required nothing from him at all. The kind of digital infection that leaves no fingerprint, only an aftertaste. For nearly nine months, while reporting on El Salvador’s negotiations with gangs, his iPhone belonged to someone else.\n\n_**“Hackers entered our phones as if they were their own.”**_\n\n_San Salvador, 2025_\n\nThe surveillance wasn’t localized. It wasn’t even targeted in any traditional sense. What began as a covert toolset for state-level actors has now matured into an open market—mercenary spyware, custom-built to bypass encryption, resist detection, and operate silently at scale.\n\nBack in Israel, inside boardrooms and booths at security expos, the brochures don’t hide the ambition.\n\nIn its brochure, NSO Group puts it plainly. Pegasus requires no clicks. It can install silently, over the air, and operate completely undetected. It can “activate the microphone,” “retrieve messages and photos,” and “view and operate” the phone in real time. The encryption that guards messages in apps like Signal and WhatsApp? Irrelevant, says NSO, because “the rest is done automatically by the system.”¹\n\nThe technology behind these exploits is dazzling in a way that recalls 20th-century illusions of magic. Except now the magician is a dashboard, and the trick requires neither audience consent nor applause. WhatsApp was the first to sue NSO in 2019 after discovering Pegasus infections delivered via unanswered calls.² Apple followed, citing a 2021 zero-click chain dubbed FORCEDENTRY, and later a 2023 attack named BLASTPASS.³ Each allowed infection with no user input, penetrating even updated phones protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode.\n\n_**“End-to-end encryption is still intact—but the ‘ends’ are poisoned.”**_\n\nThe United States knew about these tools long before it bought one.\n\nWhile the labs issued warnings and the vendors polished their demos, American agencies began quietly pulling out their wallets.\n\nIn October 2024, ICE signed a $2 million contract with Paragon Solutions, an Israeli firm that builds the Graphite spyware suite.⁴ The contract was suspended during internal review. But less than a year later—on September 1, 2025—it was reactivated under the Trump administration, just as global scrutiny of mercenary spyware hit a new peak.⁵\n\nGraphite is no theoretical product. In 2025, Citizen Lab tied it to zero-click infections on patched iPhones, describing behavior indistinguishable from Pegasus: full device compromise, encrypted message access, and persistent control.⁶ By fall, rights groups were protesting and congressional staffers were asking why a re-sanctioned vendor had resumed operations inside U.S. law enforcement.\n\n_**“A stop-work order was lifted… giving ICE access to a stealth cyber-weapon.”**_\n\nWhat does that mean in practice? That means an officer with access can open a web portal and click on a name. Behind that click, the system launches a batch of invisible probes—zero-click exploits—against that person’s phone. If even one takes, a full surveillance stream opens: messages, keystrokes, locations, camera, microphone.\n\nYou don’t need a telecom wiretap. You don’t need a hacker. You don’t even need the target to make a mistake.\n\nWhich is exactly what makes it more dangerous than anything that came before.\n\nBack then, surveillance meant tapping the line, not the person. CALEA made carriers wiretap-ready, not phones. Metadata—who you called, when, from where—was gathered in bulk under Section 215, but the message itself stayed private unless seized. Stingrays, those fake towers police used to scoop up cell traffic, pushed the edge, but still lived outside the glass.\n\nSpyware ended that boundary. It didn’t need the signal. It moved in. It turned the keyboard into a microphone, the camera into a witness. Privacy collapsed inward.\n\n_**“Yesterday’s wiretaps lived in the network. Today’s live in your pocket.”**_\n\nThat shift—device over network—explains why so many technologists, from Apple engineers to civil rights lawyers, treat mercenary spyware as a red line.⁷ It doesn’t just read encrypted messages; it reads them before they’re encrypted. It doesn’t just hear you in a room; it hears you when you’re alone.\n\nThe EU has launched a parliamentary investigation.⁶ Meta continues its lawsuit against NSO.⁸ But in America, the waters are murkier. The ICE–Paragon contract remains active.⁹ And it’s not just ICE. Reporting has connected Graphite deployments to overseas operations by the DEA and DHS in cartel contexts—again with minimal oversight and no public audit trail.¹⁰\n\nGovernments change, tools evolve, but the rationale—security over privacy—remains the same.\n\nResistance isn’t just technical—it’s cultural. Apple’s Lockdown Mode has blocked real-world Pegasus attempts. Signal and WhatsApp now flag suspected surveillance. Amnesty’s Mobile Verification Toolkit lets NGOs scan phones for traces. The fight has moved from courtrooms to keyboards.\n\n_**“The new surveillance isn’t a van with headphones. It’s a silent fingerprint on your touchscreen.”**_\n\nWhich brings us back to a different kind of warning—the one Huxley offered long before code replaced keys.\n\nThis is the world Huxley warned us about—not Orwell’s boot, but the silent architecture of total influence. In _Brave New World Revisited_, Huxley writes that democratic societies will change form not by force, but by “the relentless thrust of over-organization,” until the symbols of liberty remain while the substance has slipped away.¹¹\n\nToday, no one bans speech. They just read it in draft.\n\nNo one kicks in your door. They just flick on the camera.\n\nNo one needs to arrest you. They can watch you organize, anticipate the protest, and wait until it falls apart.\n\nThe journalists in San Salvador. The lawyers in Athens. The activists in Kampala. All they did was carry a phone.\n\nTomorrow it might be someone else—a city council candidate, a public school teacher, a church organizer. Not because they did something wrong. But because someone clicked the dashboard.\n\nThat’s the message underneath every chime in the night. Not that you’re being watched—but that you _can_ be, automatically, and the system no longer needs you to blink.\n\n_**“Automated means anyone, not everyone.”**_\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
