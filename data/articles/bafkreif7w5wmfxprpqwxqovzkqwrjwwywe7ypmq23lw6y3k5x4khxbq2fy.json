  "body": "Yesterday I finished reading “The Myth of Experience” by Emre Soyer and Robin M/ Hogarth.\n\nI have found this book very helpful for making sense of much of what I see in public online discourse.\n\nIt starts off by defining and describing two kinds of learning environments: kind learning environments, where feedback is immediate, abundant, and reliable, and wicked learning environments, where feedback is delayed, sparse, and unreliable. While some learning environments we find ourselves in are kind, many others are wicked. The result is that experience gained in a wicked learning environment often yields the wrong lessons, and thus such experience is of little use.\n\nTwo recurring questions at the end of each chapter are “What’s missing?” and “What’s irrelevant?” These two questions are essential to a proper understanding of a given topic, especially in wicked learning environments, but they are often left unasked.\n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier article, there are a lot of pieces in the conversation puzzle, and I am sure that some of those pieces are missing. I have other pieces that may be irrelevant and probably belong to a different puzzle. As such, the conclusions I draw from my observations are tentative and subject to revision. How might I know whether there is information I am missing or whether I am basing my conclusions on irrelevant information?\n\nWhile I don’t get involved in too many political discussions these days, the questions “What’s missing?” and “What’s irrelevant?” seem to linger in the background of social media posts related to politics (the same could be said of posts relating to religion and other controversial topics as well). I think it’s a good idea to consider those questions before sharing content or replying to content on social media. This, of course, requires us to slow down and think through what we put on social media, but I think that’s a good thing.\n\nIs there anything you’ve noticed that was either missing or irrelevant in social media posts in your feed recently? Have you ever looked at your own posts and noticed something that was either missing or irrelevant?",
