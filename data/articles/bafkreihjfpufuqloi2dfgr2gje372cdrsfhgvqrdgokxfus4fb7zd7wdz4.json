But the single greatest investment you can make is in yourself. **Watch Tower Wednesday** is a new biweekly series that explores the deeper, more impactful facets of life, from the perspective of a 19-year-old navigating faith, college, and calling.\n\nThrough reflections on Scripture, honest discussions of faith, and musings from day-to-day college life, _Watch Tower Wednesday_ is centered on one goal: growing in character, discipline, and spiritual maturity.\n\n***\n\n**By Crawford Anderson, with insights from Sam Medlin**\n\nAs a young man striving for purity in a world that so loudly promotes lust, mocks celibacy, and rejects God’s design for intimacy, my recent study of _1 Corinthians 7_ was both a sobering reminder and a sharp wake-up call. It compelled me to reflect on how I must live as a disciple of Christ in a culture that glorifies the opposite. As I continue to invest in myself and grow in maturity, I must wrestle with the pull of the world and examine my heart honestly and sincerely, just as I encourage you to do also, as we pursue true Christlikeness.\n\nPaul’s guidance on marriage in _1 Corinthians 7_ is both practical and spiritual. As simple as his words may seem, they carry critical meaning. He begins by reminding us that each person should be intimate only with their own spouse and that both husband and wife have duties and obligations to each other. The wife yields to the husband’s authority, and the husband yields his body to his wife. Mutual submission does not promote dominance between genders as the world would so happily declare. Instead, it represents a sacred responsibility that each partner carries to support one another, acknowledging the gift of becoming one. Marriage is a partnership of mutual devotion and selflessness.\n\n**1 Corinthians 7:4 (NIV)**\n\n_The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife._\n\n_Verse 4_ mirrors _Ephesians 5_, (_Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.)_ teaching service within marriage: the husband’s calling to love, lead, and provide, and the wife’s calling to respect and honor. Loving your wife is a divine blessing and an opportunity to reflect Christ’s love for the Church in your own partnership.\n\n**1 Corinthians 7:7 (NIV)**\n\n_I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that._\n\nPaul encourages couples not to deprive one another but to act in mutual consent, especially as they dedicate themselves to prayer and the worship of Christ. In _verse 7_, Paul explains that his own celibacy is a spiritual gift, just as each of us has our own unique gifts. He writes as a concession, not a command, recognizing the temptation Satan uses against the undisciplined. Staying unmarried is perfectly acceptable, Paul even prefers it, but for those struggling with a strong desire, he says it is _better to marry than to burn with passion_ (_1 Corinthians 7:9_).\n\n_Next week, we’ll continue this reflection in Part 2 as we look deeper at singleness, purpose, and devotion to Christ. Until then:_\n\n**“Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus.” — Hebrews 12:1–2 (NIV)**\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
