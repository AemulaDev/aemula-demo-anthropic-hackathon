  "body": "*I began my last article by noting that Los Angeles Is(n't?) Burning, Part 2 is scheduled to come next pending further developments vis-a-vis Iran. Bombing them-entering, then ending, a war-is such a development. There have also been major developments with respect to the Big Beautiful Bill, which, as of this morning, has passed both houses of Congress and is on its way to the president's desk. I won't go so far now, 16 months out from the midterm elections, to say that Republicans sealed the fate of-and placed a definite expiration date on-their majority in the House-but others will, and they might be right.*\n\nI was 11 years old when Al-Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked commercial jets into the Twin Towers, Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. I didn't have any real sense of politics, and my parents were years away from shedding the mantle of studious non-partisanship they wore around my younger brothers and me, but I knew-as a sixth-grader knows-that America had been attacked, and that America-the beautiful, yes, but also the good, the right, and the strong-would respond.\n\nMuch of what I felt at 11, I might have felt because I was 11, but polls from the period confirm I wasn't alone: people felt *good* about America, and good about being American. 91% of Americans [felt](https://news.gallup.com/poll/692150/american-pride-slips-new-low.aspx?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=The%20Pride%20Slide&utm_campaign=Daily%20newsletter%207%2F1%2F2025) \"extremely\" or \"very\" proud to be American-85% of independents, 92% of Democrats, and 98% of Republicans. President Bush's approval rating [spiked](https://news.gallup.com/interactives/507569/presidential-job-approval-center.aspx) to 90% in polls conducted on September 21 and 22, 2001, the high point of presidential popularity since Gallup began asking Americans how they view the president in June 1945. A moving average of 54% of Americans told [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/) they trusted the government to do the right thing just about always or most of the time, which might not seem so great until you learn that was-and remains-the only time since 1970 the number has been that high.\n\nMuch has changed over the last 24 years.\n\n*************\n\nOn the evening of Saturday, June 21st-early Sunday in Iran-the American military launched precision attacks on three sites key to Iran's nuclear enrichment program. Six B-2 bombers [each dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/21/world/iran-israel-trump?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) a pair of 30,000-pound \"bunker buster\" Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on the fortified, deep-underground Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant; another B-2 dropped two MOPs on the Natanz Nuclear Facility, a larger enrichment plant; and Navy submarines fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Natanz facility and a third site near Isfahan where Iran was believed to store uranium enriched near to the levels necessary for a nuclear bomb.\n\nPresident Trump, speaking from the White House with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth standing straight-backed and somber behind him, [claimed](https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-speech-transcript-text-ff4b286992309ec1337e04260247bb1e) \"the strikes were a spectacular military success\\[,\\]\" and that \"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities \\[were\\] completely and totally obliterated.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, [accused](https://x.com/araghchi/status/1936638107169722536) the United States of \"a grave violation of the UN Charter, international law and the \\[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\\]\" warning that the \"outrageous\" attack would \"have everlasting consequences.\"\n\nThough questions remain, we know more now than we did that night. The casus belli was less Iranian proximity to a nuclear weapon and more opportunity [offered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/23/netanyahu-iran-attack-nuclear-intelligence/) by a weakened Iran. Whatever the risk of metastasis might have been, Iran's response was [telegraphed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/qatar-explosions-us-air-base-strikes-on-iran/) ahead of time and designed to save face domestically without giving the U.S. cause for escalation. Less than 48 hours after the initial American assault, Trump [announced](https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-ceasefire-agreement-terms-b5fc5cc8a8c32b4899646130b496798a) a ceasefire between Israel and Iran; since a [rocky start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGVmkppGE_s), the ceasefire has held. The Pentagon [claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/us-strikes-iran-pentagon-trump) Iran's nuclear program was set back 1-2 years, contradicting an [earlier report](https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-program-military-strikes-trump-f0fc085a2605e7da3e2f47ff9ac0e01d) from the Defense Intelligence Agency, an agency of the Department of Defense, which claimed a setback of just months. Despite the attack, Iran [intends](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/iran-nuclear-trump-talks-uranium-strikes-rcna216689) to continue its nuclear enrichment program.\n\nFor a moment, though, go back to that weekend, to the brief window where we could only guess at what was coming.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!InJo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F127c38e0-f093-4cb5-b908-6f2517f46be2_1600x1067.png)\n\n*************\n\nI make no bones about not being particularly enamored with President Trump. I know and like to think I understand many who are, but for all the flaws I think Vice President Harris showed as a candidate and would have displayed as president; the still-growing disillusionment and revulsion-the *sadness*-I felt and feel at a diminished President Biden's contemptible decision to run for reelection; and the perhaps greater disillusionment and revulsion I felt at the craven refusal of any prominent Democrats to publicly oppose that decision or push for an open and risky but faith-restoring primary process to select his replacement-the last year or ten have scabbed the knees and stubbed the toes of your local libs-voting for Harris and Governor Tim Walz wasn't difficult.\n\nNothing that has happened over the eight months since the election has made me question that vote, stop wishing Harris and Walz had won, or stop believing America would be a better place and would be in a better place overall had they won. That might be especially true this week as Congress advances Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, a lengthy piece of legislation I intend to write about fairly and in some detail, but which, as of this point in time, I oppose in the generalities and the particulars.\n\nBut as liberal as I may be, and as much time as I've spent in the college humanities courses so many conservatives blame for the country's demise, and as cognizant as I am of America's bona fide moral failings and misadventures both domestic and foreign, there's a big chunk of my heart that is, or wants to be, red-blooded, eagle-loving, not-much-of-a-gun-guy-but-I've-shot-them-and-I-kind-of-get-it, Teddy-Roosevelt-is-my-personal-hero, Americanist American.\n\nWhen Trump spoke at the White House-before I read the dissenting views of anti-interventionists, those dedicated to a diplomatic solution, and Iranian expatriates devastated for their homeland even as they decried its government-I wanted to believe him. I maybe even wanted to believe *in* him. I wanted to believe America was right-was *good*-to join Israel's ongoing air war with Iran. And I wanted to believe that, as I might have at 11, based solely on the fact that we had done it. What American does is good, and America bombed Iran; ergo, bombing Iran must be good.\n\nBut I'm not 11, and this isn't 2001.\n\n### A Crisis of Faith\n\nIn 1958, the Pew Research Center began asking Americans a [simple question](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/PP_2024.6.24_role-of-government_TOPLINE.pdf): \"How much of the time do you think you can trust the federal government to do what is right?\"\n\nThe percentage of respondents who answer \"just about always\" or \"most of the time\" has [plummeted](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/) over time. When the project began, Americans had what now seems an impossible faith in their government. In 1958, with President Eisenhower at the helm, 73%; in 1964, under President Johnson, 77%.\n\nBy 1980, the last year of President Carter's term, the moving average across all polls was down to 27%. Under Reagan, the downward trend reversed, but the moving average never exceeded 45%. The last time over half of Americans trusted their government was in the wake of the September 11th attacks. The last time even a *quarter* of Americans really trusted their government was in 2008: the moving average never rose above 24% during the Obama, Trump I, or Biden administrations. The distrust is bipartisan: though there are [stark differences](https://news.gallup.com/poll/692150/american-pride-slips-new-low.aspx?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=The%20Pride%20Slide&utm_campaign=Daily%20newsletter%207%2F1%2F2025) in how patriotic Democrats and Republicans feel, no more than 37% of each group ever trusted the government over that same 2008-2024 period.\n\nIt doesn't take an advanced degree or divine revelation to form a theory as to why so many Americans stopped trusting their government. In fact, it might be harder to understand why-after Vietnam, Watergate, the Church Committee, Iraq, various inflation-related and other financial crises and stock market crashes, Covid, the explosion of money in politics, and, in recent years, constant, brutal, degrading competition between a Republican Party led by Donald Trump, whom half the country can't stand-believe me, Republicans: if you didn't like his politics, you'd be in the same boat-and a Democratic Party led by politicians of dubious quality who too often emulate [the dodos from the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7B-1mLMpHw) *[Ice Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7B-1mLMpHw)*, concurrently manipulative, controlling, and unwittingly hell-bent on their own extinction-why, after all that, *anyone* would trust the government.\n\nAnd it isn't just the big events. There's an argument that some of the general dissatisfaction with the government comes from a simple mismatch between what is expected and what is provided, and sometimes what is expected and what is possible. The government's tools are blunt and imprecise, and the representatives we elect to wield them disagree as to how, usually compromising with an approach that makes everyone at least a little bit grumpy; even under the best of circumstances, the federal government leaves chasms, not cracks.\n\nAs Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once put it:\n\n> \"The stability of democracy depends very much on the people making a careful distinction between what government can do and what it cannot do. To demand what can be done is altogether in order: some may wish such things accomplished, some may not, and the majority may decide. But to seek what cannot be provided, especially to do so with the passionate but misinformed conviction that it can be, is to create the conditions of frustration and ruin.\"\n\nI would add to Senator Moynihan that I think the long-term stability of a democratic government also depends on whether the people it purports to serve trust it to do so.\n\nIt all paints a rather bleak picture. Admittedly-and thankfully-there is a sizable gap between skepticism of the government, be it justified or not, and active revolt or defiance of government action. It is also true that \"do you trust the government?\" is an exceedingly broad question: do you trust the post office to deliver to the right address in a timely manner? Trust our respective congresspeople to advocate for our interests without regard to their personal advantage? Trust the federal agencies to do their respective jobs? Trust the president and his advisors to conduct a responsible foreign policy that maintains or increases America's preeminent standing in the world? Trust Congress to soberly debate and ultimately pass legislation that will benefit us both now and in the future? Each time the government changes hands, our answers to some questions might flip.\n\nOthers might note that, in this generations-long period of low trust and dissatisfaction, America has nonetheless made material progress in recognizing the civil rights of historically persecuted minorities; maintained much of its diplomatic, military, and cultural preeminence on the world stage; and increased the material well-being of many of its least-well-off citizens.\n\nBut an unpopular, untrustworthy government isn't so unlike one of those awesome stilt houses on the coast of North Carolina, or the Sermon on the Mount's house built upon the sand: safe for now, perhaps, but poorly positioned for the next storm.\n\n### Hope\n\nYet hope abounds, and often in curious places. Today, I want to point out just one.\n\nSome months ago, I [spoke](https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/p/moral-individualism-with-professors?r=5wrb1) to Professors Kelly Patterson and Chris Karpowitz of Brigham Young University about their work on moral individualism, a measure of autonomy from authority. According to research they conducted between 2018 and 2022, moral individualists were \"far less likely to engage in collective action or pursue other behaviors meant to assist the community.\"\n\nMoral individualism, in and of itself, is neither good nor bad: there are clear downsides to being too beholden to authority, and clear downsides to not being beholden enough. But too much moral individualism eats away at one of society's foundational pillars: trust.\n\nAs part of their [weekly polling effort](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_uvch8qB.pdf), conducted from June 20-23, 2025, *The Economist* and YouGov asked respondents whether they supported U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities. It wasn't until Saturday evening, well after the survey was launched and responses had begun rolling in, that President Trump announced the U.S. attack. Of Republicans [who responded prior](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52434-donald-trump-slump-job-approval-continues-bombing-iran-trump-budget-no-kings-protests-military-parades-june-20-23-2025-economist-yougov-poll) to the announcement, 34% supported bombing, and 34% were unsure; of those who responded after, 70% supported bombing, and just 13% were unsure. Of Democrats who responded before the announcement, 56% opposed bombing; of those who responded after, 74%.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r0pD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d700f4d-e81d-4edd-9b06-636cda07a8b0_578x618.png)\n\nThree possible explanations immediately come to mind. The first and least likely is that the more hawkish Republicans and dovish Democrats were, by some remarkable coincidence, simply waiting until later in the weekend to respond, and that the shift in percentages had nothing to do with the actual attack.\n\nThe second is that, in each case for reasons completely unrelated to politics, previously skeptical Republicans read the news of the attack, thought, \"I was against bombing, but this worked out much better than I feared,\" and then turned to the survey, and that previously bullish Democrats read the same news, thought, \"I might have supported some kind of bombing, but not this,\" and relied on the poll as an outlet to express their frustration.\n\nAnd the third-and most likely by far-is that many of us take our cues from our elected leaders. Trump's support for a proposition makes Republican support more likely and Democratic support less so; the obverse is true if you replace Trump with whomever people might view as the current leader of the Democratic Party. Trump having bombed Iran makes bombing Iran more appealing to some Republicans and less so to some Democrats.\n\nIt would be easy enough to turn that into another generic article lamenting Americans' lack of political principle-\"Don't Look Now, But You're Surrounded By Rudderless Sycophants\". There is no question that most people's views are malleable, and subject to change based on factors other than extended personal study and analysis.\n\nBut I actually think that's *good*.\n\nEach of us likely has a set of issues we understand well or about which we feel strongly. Those core issues can provide the building blocks for an ideology and the basis for a vote. For most of us, the overlap between our foundation and that of a party or candidate won't be perfect-we vote for the candidate who is closer, hoping the issues on which we disagree will end up low on the government's priority list.\n\nBut there are always going to be many, many other issues we *can't* understand with genuine depth. There simply isn't enough time in the day-or in a lifetime-to be completely, independently informed on each and every political subject and to hold down a job, spend time with family, or do any number of the other things which sustain life and give it flavor. It's not even possible for *congresspeople* to be completely, independently informed. There's a reason lobbyists and advocacy groups continue to exist-perhaps regrettably, they're needed.\n\nAnd it's on those other issues that we need to exercise *trust*.\n\nI would hazard a guess that, as with virtually every other issue, whether or not we should bomb Iran is only a core concern for a subset of the population. For that subset, what the president does is unlikely to shift them one way or the other, at least over the short term-Republican support didn't jump to 100%, and Democratic support didn't drop to 0%. But for those who are less well-informed on foreign affairs, less adamant about military intervention or non-intervention, and less well-connected personally to the Israel-Iran and Israel-Palestine conflicts, what the president does might change everything. For those who, for whatever reason, trust the president to do the right thing, the bombing starts to make more sense; for those who, for whatever reason, trust him to do the wrong thing, it starts to make much less sense.\n\nLet me end with this: for all those angry that so many of your fellow Americans uncritically trust Trump, mainstream media figures, alternative media figures, or some other political opinion driver, it could be worse: they who trust the wrongbody are closer to trusting the rightbody than they who trust *nobody*.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, tells us something about persuasion: it starts with trust.\n\n*This article reproduces content from Never Close the Inquiry, written by Nick Hagen, and is available at [https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/](https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/).
