Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nA dollar here, five bucks there, it's just enough to buy a lemonade from the neighborhood kid. Although the corporate debt featured in _[When Walmart Pays My Bills](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/when-walmart-pays-my-bills?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=false)_ can juice up your sleepy cash savings, it only goes so far in a savings portfolio like my Short-Term Strategic Reserve (STSR). The real rocket fuel comes from higher-risk, higher-reward investments.\n\nHere's the thing: I don't want to manage my portfolio full-time. I don't want to be constantly buying and selling stocks. But what if there were a way to collect 10–12% dividends, paid monthly, dropping into my account like clockwork? That's where the options market, specifically covered calls, come in.\n\n### So you're not a Finance Bro? Start here:\n\n* **ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund):** A bundle of stocks that trades as one single stock.\n\n* **Index:** A benchmark group of companies representing part of the market.\n\n* **Call Option:** A contract giving the right (not obligation) to buy at a set price by a deadline.\n\n* **Covered Call:** Selling a call option on shares you already own for extra Income.\n\n* **Exercising a Call:** Using the right to buy stock at the strike price for a profit.\n\n* **Strike Price:** The pre-set price at which an option can be exercised.\n\n* **Out of the Money (OTM):** When the strike price is above the stock's current price.\n\n* **Premium:** The upfront payment you earn for selling an option.\n\n### When Life Gives You Lemons… Write An Option\n\nIn my _income-focused account_, I need the money today, not just 30 years from now. That's where my _**LIST**_ principles—**Liquidity, Income, Stability, Tax Efficiency**—come into play. In Tier 3, the stars of the show are **Income** and **Tax Efficiency.**\n\nYou're a kid running a lemonade stand. You have 10 cups of lemonade ready to sell for $1 each. A neighbor comes by and says, \"I think lemonade prices are about to spike. What if I give you 10 cents now for the right to buy all your lemonade at $1 a cup anytime this afternoon?\" If lemonade prices jump to $2, your neighbor swoops in, buys at $1, and flips it for $2. You miss out on the extra profit, but you keep the 10-cent premium upfront. If prices stay at $1 or fall, the neighbor never exercises their option. You pocket the 10 cents and still sell your lemonade as usual.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdSe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b88a3b5-267b-4c2b-b685-346405bf4c6d_1723x989.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xdSe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b88a3b5-267b-4c2b-b685-346405bf4c6d_1723x989.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:My brother and friend disrupting the neighborhood Lemonade market with $2 cups}}\n\nThat's a covered call in kid-sized terms. You own the lemonade (shares), sell someone else the right to buy it at a set price (**the strike**), and keep the premium either way. Not bad for enjoying the shade of the garage while your lemonade sells itself.\n\nSounds easy, right? Well, in practice, selling options yourself requires knowing the math, managing risk, and handling contracts of 100 shares at a time (known as lots). That's not something I'm looking to juggle between classes and late-night study sessions. Enter covered call ETFs. Funds like **SPYI** and **QQQI** hold the actual index shares and sell out-of-the-money calls on them, providing me with an income stream without requiring me to play the role of an options trader.\n\n### No Such Thing as Free Lemonade…\n\n**Covered calls** aren't free money. The premium always comes with a price tag; if the underlying stock or index skyrockets, you're capping your potential gains. The ETF structure and options strategy make this less painful because you still get some upside, but it's limited compared to just holding the index outright. That's the trade: give up some rocket-ship growth for reliable, high-percentage Income. In a portfolio built around Income and cash flow, that's a trade I'm willing to make.\n\n_Next week, we'll graduate from lemonade stands to Wall Street. I'll break down the exact covered call ETFs I use and why they've earned a permanent seat in Tier 3. They don't sell lemonade—just dividends that keep pouring._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
