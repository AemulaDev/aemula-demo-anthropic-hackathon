  "body": "[Listen to Episode](https://understandingpolitics.substack.com/p/why-empathy-is-a-trigger-word-now)\n\nSeveral weeks ago, a Braver Angels volunteer in eastern Washington mentioned that he’d met a friend of mine from Idaho and he wondered whether we’d be interested in having a Braver Angels conversation about Christian Nationalism and regarding his concern around hearing about the word ‘empathy’ having been weaponized.\n\nI’m always interested in good conversation and Kaeley is a wonderful expert, communicator, and friend, so I agreed!\n\nWe recorded this toward the end of March and I’ve been hanging on to the audio since then.\n\nPlease let me know what you think. Did you enjoy this? Learn something from it? Have a question? Would you like to hear more things like this?\n\nLet me know! This is the first time I’ve ever posted anything like this to my Substack but I do occasionally find myself on podcasts and have considered launching my own.",
