Leaders repeated the phrase “rules-based international order” often enough that it began to function less as a description than as a comfort.\n\nCarney withdrew that comfort immediately.\n\n“Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised.”¹\n\nHe did not call this a transition. He called it a rupture—not slow change, but a break in the logic that governed the past generation.\n\nThe break, in his telling, is not that great powers are behaving badly. Great powers always behave badly when they can. The break is that **economic integration itself has become the instrument of pressure.**\n\nThis is no longer theoretical. Access to the SWIFT payments system has become a sanction of first resort.² Export controls on advanced semiconductors now determine the fate of entire technology sectors.³ Rare-earth supply chains are tightened not to raise prices, but to discipline policy.⁴ LNG terminals, port insurance, and secondary sanctions have all become pressure points in what used to be treated as neutral infrastructure—across multiple great-power systems.⁵\n\nCarney names the pattern directly.\n\nTariffs are now leverage.\n\nFinancial infrastructure is coercion.\n\nSupply chains are vulnerabilities to be exploited.\n\nAnd in that environment, he says, the most dangerous reflex is not aggression.\n\nIt is accommodation.\n\n“There is a strong tendency…to accommodate, to avoid trouble, to hope that compliance will buy safety. Well, it won’t.”¹\n\nThis is where the speech stops being about geopolitics and starts being about behavior.\n\nHere Carney is not describing how states act in theory. He is describing how institutions act in practice. When your factories depend on one port, when your pension funds depend on one market, when your growth depends on one clearing system, you do not confront the hand that can quietly close the valve. You soften language. You delay decisions. You explain to yourself that this is prudence, not submission.\n\nOnly then does he reach for Václav Havel.\n\nIn the 1970s, Havel wrote about a greengrocer who placed a sign in his window every morning: **“Workers of the world, unite.”** The man did not believe the slogan. His customers did not believe it. The sign was not propaganda. It was insurance. It said: I am not a problem. I will perform the ritual. I will not attract attention. And because every shopkeeper on every street did the same, Havel wrote, the system held—not through violence alone, but through the quiet cooperation of people who privately knew the words were false.⁶\n\nCarney’s line to the Davos audience was spare.\n\n“Friends, it is time for companies and countries to take their signs down.”¹\n\nThis is where the speech becomes unsettling.\n\nHe is not accusing anyone of ideological dishonesty. He is accusing them of procedural compliance—of confusing silence with neutrality, of mistaking caution for independence.\n\nWhen countries condemn economic intimidation from one direction and stay silent when it comes from another, he says, “we are keeping the sign in the window.”¹\n\nMost of the people in that room make their living managing exposure, not confronting it. Corporate risk teams call it volatility. Governments call it realism. Boards call it fiduciary duty. But in practice, it is a long series of small decisions that trade sovereignty for predictability.\n\nFor decades, Carney acknowledges, that bargain made sense. American hegemony provided public goods: open sea lanes, stable finance, collective security. The rules were uneven, but the system delivered enough stability that middle powers could live with the hypocrisy.⁷\n\nSo they placed the sign in the window.\n\n“We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality.”¹\n\nThat era, he says, is over.\n\nCrises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics exposed how fragile extreme integration had become. Then something more deliberate happened. Great powers began using that integration itself as leverage. You cannot pretend mutual benefit when dependence becomes subordination.\n\nThis is where Carney rewrites the meaning of sovereignty.\n\nNot formal independence.\n\nNot flags or speeches.\n\nBut, as he frames it, the ability to absorb pressure without breaking.¹\n\nA country that cannot feed itself, fuel itself, finance itself, or defend itself has few real choices when coercion arrives. When rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself. Yet Carney refuses the easy answer. A world of fortresses will be poorer, more fragile, less sustainable. Autonomy costs money. Redundancy costs efficiency. Insurance costs growth.⁸\n\nThen he delivers the line that sounds less like moral philosophy and more like risk analysis.\n\n“Hegemons cannot continually monetize their relationships.”¹\n\nDependence triggers hedging. Allies diversify. They buy insurance not out of ideology but out of fear.\n\nThis is where his proposal becomes practical.\n\nCarney does not trust the old institutions to move fast enough. He does not believe universal consensus is coming back. Instead, he proposes overlapping coalitions—what he calls variable geometry—different alliances for different problems, designed to let middle powers bargain from something closer to strength.¹\n\nIn a world where bilateral negotiation with a hegemon is negotiation from weakness, middle powers must combine or be played off against one another. “If we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.”¹ This is not romance. It is arithmetic. Individually, middle powers are manageable. Collectively, they are expensive to coerce.\n\nThe most revealing line in the speech comes later.\n\n**“This is not sovereignty. It’s the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination,”** he says.¹\n\nThat is the greengrocer again: formal independence paired with practical vulnerability, ritual freedom masking real dependence.\n\nWhat does it mean, he asks, to live the truth in a world like this?\n\nIt means stopping the pretense that the system works as described. It means applying standards consistently. It means building what you claim to believe in—not slogans, but capacity; not declarations, but resilience; not virtue, but redundancy.¹\n\nThen comes the sentence that anchors the entire argument.\n\n“Countries earn the right to principled stands by reducing their vulnerability to retaliation.”¹\n\nThis is not about virtue.\n\nIt is about leverage.\n\nOnly countries that can survive retaliation can afford honesty. Only firms that can absorb pressure can afford independence. Only societies willing to spend money, accept inefficiency, and build slack into their systems can keep their future choices open.\n\nNear the end, Carney turns to Canada. Here the speech becomes demonstrative rather than philosophical: removing interprovincial trade barriers, accelerating critical-mineral supply chains, joining European defense procurement, deliberately diversifying trade away from single-point dependencies.¹ These are not gestures. They are attempts, however imperfect, to translate rhetoric into insulation.\n\nThis is what gives weight to his final claim.\n\n“We are taking the sign out of the window.”¹\n\nNot because the old order was evil, but because nostalgia is not a strategy.\n\nThe choice he leaves the room with is not between courage and cowardice.\n\nIt is between convergence and divergence.\n\nBetween a world in which dependencies quietly compound until they harden into hierarchy, and a world in which states deliberately accept cost and inefficiency in order to preserve room to act.\n\nThe powerful will have their power.\n\nEveryone else will decide, slowly and structurally, whether they are building a system that drifts toward subordination—or one that can still afford, when it matters, to take the sign down.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
