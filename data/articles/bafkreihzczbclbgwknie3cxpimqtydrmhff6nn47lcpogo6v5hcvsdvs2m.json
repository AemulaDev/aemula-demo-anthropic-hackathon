But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her._\n\nIn _verses 10–12_, Paul distinguishes between his personal guidance and the Lord’s direct commands. Later, in _verses 17–21_, he emphasizes that we should live faithfully in the situation to which we were called.\n\n_Verse 12_ emphasizes that a family does not find salvation through just the husband’s faith; instead, they receive blessings through God’s presence that accompanies him. The marriage structure extends sanctification—rather than salvation—especially when one spouse becomes a disciple while the other has not yet believed.\n\nIn both seasons of persistent loneliness and in times filled with close relationships, we must actively choose to live as Christ did, even as He remains consistently near to us. Being single does not mean we failed somewhere. A wife does not complete a person—only Christ fulfills that role. We must guard against chasing worldly relationships for emotional comfort, as love can easily blur into lust.\n\nLoneliness is one of Satan’s easiest tools. Feeling empty without a partner should lead us not toward earthly attachment but toward deeper intimacy with the Lord. We are called to be _equally yoked_ (_2 Corinthians 6:14 Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.)_ in all relationships, aligning our hearts with Christ before aligning them with another person.\n\n**1 Corinthians 7:22–23 (NIV)**\n\n_For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave._\n\n_You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings._\n\n_Verses 22–23_ call us to change from the inside out, starting with our hearts, not our situation. As _verse 19_ reminds us, “Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts.” God will bring the right person at the right time. We must not fall into the trap of the grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side, because neither singleness nor marriage solves the deeper issues of the heart.\n\n**1 Corinthians 7:29–31 (NIV)**\n\n_What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away._\n\nIn _verses 29–31_, Paul reminds believers that even within marriage, one’s relationship with God must remain the top priority. Marriage and family are godly gifts designed to support us on earth. Still, they pale in comparison to our eternal duty to God. The world in its present form is passing away, so our relationship with Christ must remain above all else.\n\n**1 Corinthians 7:40 (NIV)**\n\n_In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God._\n\nFinally, _verse 40_ reminds us that Paul speaks with the Spirit of God, offering wisdom born of divine counsel. His conclusion is straightforward: waiting is the best approach. Just because someone shows interest or stirs emotion does not mean they are God’s will. We must guide everything we do by godly intent rather than by fleshly desire.\n\nOnly Jesus can fill the void we feel in our hearts. Many young Christian men fall into the snare of rushing into marriage for physical fulfillment, but Paul’s words caution us to prioritize Christ first and serve Him faithfully. Even a godly woman can become an idol if loved more than God Himself. Boundaries, prayer, and patience are essential safeguards. Marriage is a blessing, but true fulfillment is found only in a living relationship with Christ.\n\nIn summary, Paul highlights the beauty and wisdom of waiting for the sacred union of marriage, the ultimate form of God-ordained intimacy. The Lord intended for this connection to bring deep satisfaction and fulfillment, but it only achieves that when pursued in a godly and divine manner. Christ alone fills the space in our hearts that marriage was never designed to fulfill.\n\n_Singleness and marriage are both gifts, but Christ alone is our salvation. Until next time:_\n\n**“Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus.” — Hebrews 12:1–2 (NIV)**\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
