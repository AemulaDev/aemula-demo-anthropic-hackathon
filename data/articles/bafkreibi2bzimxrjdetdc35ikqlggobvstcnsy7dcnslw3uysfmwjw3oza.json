In Ottawa, a flag snaps sharply against its pole outside a government building that has not yet filled for the day, each crack echoing down a street still half-dark at seven in the morning. In Mexico City, the same hour smells of diesel and sweet bread, vendors already calling out orders as radios repeat the same overnight news: on January 2, 2026, the United States removed another foreign leader by force.¹\n\nAnd on phones, almost as an afterthought, something stranger—also on January 2, 2026: Katie Miller, the wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, posted an image of Greenland overlaid with the American flag and the caption “SOON.”² Denmark lodged a formal protest within hours. European diplomats quietly took screenshots. The image vanished quickly, but the signal did not.\n\nThe reactions could not look more different. In Ottawa, officials are still speaking carefully, reaching for words like “process” and “stability.” In Mexico City, the language has already turned colder, more legal. In Copenhagen, irritation hardened into alarm almost immediately. But the question forming in all three places is the same, even if it is not yet being said aloud.\n\nIf this can happen there—why not here?\n\nTo be clear about what “this” is: on January 2, 2026, the United States carried out a covert, military-backed operation to extract Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, transferring him to U.S. custody and then publicly describing the action not only as law enforcement, but as the beginning of American control over Venezuela’s political and economic future.³ Within hours, Colombia requested an emergency United Nations Security Council session, backed by Russia and China;⁴ European governments issued unusually sharp condemnations;⁵ and the UN Secretary-General warned that the action represented a “dangerous precedent.”⁴\n\nThat sequence matters more than the man removed.\n\nThe United States has intervened abroad many times before. What distinguishes this episode is not the use of force itself, but its framing—and its speed: extraction without international authorization, paired almost immediately with rhetoric of managerial control rather than transitional restraint. It collapses enforcement, regime change, and governance into a single act and treats the combination as normal before the international system has time to respond.⁶ The Greenland image mattered for the same reason. It arrived before explanation, before clarification, before restraint. Territory rendered as suggestion.\n\nHistory does not repeat because leaders forget it. It repeats because systems reward behaviors that appear to work—especially when they unfold faster than opposition can organize.\n\nThis is the shift the world is reacting to now, in real time. Not the downfall of a Venezuelan autocrat, but the normalization of unilateral force as administrative practice—force presented not as war, but as management.\n\nMexico understands this instinctively. It always has.\n\nMexico is not weak. It is rhetorically vulnerable. For decades, U.S. domestic politics have treated Mexico less as a sovereign partner than as a recurring plot device: drugs, migration, cartels, invasion. Those words collapse foreign policy into crime drama. They turn diplomacy into policing. They make cross-border pressure sound like common sense.⁷\n\nWhen the United States extracts a foreign leader under an elastic theory of “law enforcement,” Mexico hears something specific immediately: sovereignty has become conditional. Not abolished, but graded. Compliance earns respect. Resistance earns scrutiny.\n\nThat is why Mexico’s response to the January 2 operation was deliberately restrained and legalistic. It did not rush to defend Maduro. It did not rush to celebrate his removal. It defended process. Mexico’s non-intervention doctrine is not idealism; it is institutional memory. Territorial loss. Gunboat diplomacy. Intelligence meddling. Economic coercion. These are not metaphors in Mexico. They are chapters.⁸\n\nIf Venezuela is a proof of concept, Mexico is the case study everyone is watching.\n\nCanada’s position is quieter—and, in some ways, more precarious.\n\nCanada is rarely framed as foreign in Washington. It is framed as familiar. Reliable. A place whose alignment can be assumed rather than negotiated. That familiarity is not benign. It is how sovereignty erodes politely.\n\nCanada’s vulnerability is not crime rhetoric but dependency: energy integration, Arctic access, continental defense, intelligence sharing, trade regimes that function more by habit than by enforcement. None of this implies invasion. It implies management. Pressure that arrives as coordination. Expectations enforced through access.⁹\n\nFor decades, those arrangements rested on shared process—NATO norms, UN legitimacy, treaty discipline. January 2 demonstrated how quickly those constraints can be bypassed. Canada’s concern was not helicopters over Parliament Hill. It was the speed with which multilateral process was discarded when it became inconvenient.¹⁰\n\nEurope grasped this immediately. That is why the response from Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Brussels—and now Copenhagen—arrived within hours and sounded so similar. Respect for sovereignty. International law. Dangerous precedent. These were not moral objections. They were defensive ones.⁵\n\nOne detail from Brussels captures the mood. During emergency consultations held late on January 2, an EU diplomat described the concern not as disagreement with Washington’s goals, but as fear that “the paperwork no longer matters.”¹¹ The anxiety was procedural and urgent: if rules become optional for allies overnight, they will certainly be optional for rivals tomorrow. Denmark’s response to the Greenland post followed the same logic. The offense was not satire. It was implication.\n\nChina and Russia responded differently, but no less strategically—and almost immediately. They did not defend Maduro’s rule. They highlighted method. Because every time the United States treats international law as optional, it becomes harder to object when someone else does the same—whether in Ukraine, Taiwan, or the Arctic.⁴¹²\n\nThis is why the UN Security Council meeting scheduled for today matters, even though everyone knows nothing binding will pass. The Council is not there to restrain Washington. It is there to record what just happened. To force states to state their positions publicly. To begin converting unilateral action into reputational cost.⁴\n\nInternational systems rarely collapse in a single breach. They erode through tolerated exceptions—and sometimes through tolerated speed.\n\nThat does not mean the United States is unconstrained. It is not. Domestic law, congressional authority, judicial review, alliance politics, economic interdependence—all remain real brakes. Even within the administration, there are officials acutely aware that overreach invites backlash. Europe’s resistance is not cost-free. Mexico has leverage. Canada has allies. Denmark has treaties.¹⁰¹³\n\nBut constraints only matter if they are enforced in time. What January 2 demonstrated—both in Venezuela and on social media—is that the political rewards of force and insinuation can arrive faster than the costs. That calculation is what other states are now reassessing.\n\nMexico is not “next” in a cinematic sense. Canada is not about to be absorbed. Greenland is not about to be annexed. But all three are next in logic—and that logic is now moving quickly.\n\nMexico is the tripwire. If pressure escalates there, the Global South will treat it as confirmation that sovereignty in the Western Hemisphere is conditional on alignment.⁷⁸\n\nCanada is the boundary condition. If a country that close, that integrated, that formally allied can be treated as a managed space rather than a sovereign partner, the illusion of benign American leadership fractures publicly.⁹¹⁰\n\nAnd Greenland—remote, strategic, legally Danish—is the tell. When even joking imagery begins mapping possession within hours of a foreign extraction, it signals that the concept of restraint has loosened its grip.\n\nThis is why the question lingers now in Ottawa and Mexico City and Copenhagen alike. Not because anyone expects tanks, but because everyone understands precedent—and because precedent now moves faster than it used to.\n\nThe flag in Ottawa keeps snapping in the cold, sound carrying farther than it should. In Mexico City, radios move on to traffic and weather. In Copenhagen, officials draft a protest note they never expected to write—less than twenty-four hours after the image appeared. Life continues. But calculation has already changed.\n\nIf this can happen there—why not here?\n\nThat is not fear speaking. It is something quieter, and harder to reverse: the moment when rules stop feeling solid underfoot.\n\n⸻\n\nBiibliography\n\n1\\.
