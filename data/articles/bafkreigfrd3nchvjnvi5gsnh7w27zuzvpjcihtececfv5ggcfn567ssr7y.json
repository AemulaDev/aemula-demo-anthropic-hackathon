  "body": "_I attended an event this morning about current trends in philanthropy, particularly Effective Altruism (EA). The event gave me a lot to think about and I will post more about it soon. One thing I realized during the event is that, for people who aren’t highly connected in the Bay Area, it can look like EA is the only philanthropic trend in town. And, to be sure, EA is a notable and important philanthropic community! But there are other local projects too, with their own perspective on how to do philanthropy differently._\n\n_The brief interview below was originally published in_ _[my print magazine](https://thenewmodality.com/)_ _in 2020. I’ve added some new details to the introduction below, but the text of the interview itself is the same as what I published in 2020._\n\n—\n\nColleen Gregerson began her career in the nonprofit world, and starting in 2015, she worked in philanthropic innovation. When I met her, she was executive director at Battery Powered, which is the philanthropy program at The Battery, a social club in San Francisco; previously, Colleen led [Maverick Collective](https://maverickcollective.org/about/), a group within the international organization Population Services International that aims to fund innovative projects in the developing world.\n\nPlease note: I am biased about The Battery because they gave me a residency in 2017, and I did a bunch of media work for the founders between 2017-2020. Since 2020, however, I haven’t spent as much time there. I don’t know much about what they have been up to in recent years. I’ve heard that Battery Powered is still operating, but Colleen has moved on to a new job since this interview.\n\nThis interview is a bit more “promotional-feeling” than most of the material I publish. I guess this is partly because I’m biased about them. But I also think Battery Powered is actually a cool program, so I wanted to give Colleen a chance to gush about it.\n\n**LYDIA LAURENSON: From what I understand, it’s hard to do innovative work in the traditional funding world because the money is usually circumscribed. It has lots of conditions placed on it.**\n\nCOLLEEN GREGERSON: Yes, that’s true. And it’s sensible! Funders want to invest in programs that they know will work, to feel reassured they’ll have an impact. That’s wonderful for scaling up proven models, but we need more risk-tolerant funding when we try new things.\n\nAfter some time in the philanthropy ecosystem, you learn that each type of funding serves a purpose. You need to match the appropriate funding for the appropriate intervention, at the appropriate stage of a program. Maverick Collective was a community of risk-tolerant individual funders who filled an important gap in the ecosystem. Not all the Maverick programs worked, but when they did, we had a base of evidence, and we could go to established institutional funders and get funding to scale them up.\n\n**LYDIA: From Maverick Collective, you moved to Battery Powered, which is intended to bring new people into philanthropy and to help philanthropists connect with each other. Institutional philanthropy is often anchored by wealthy individuals who establish their own foundations or work alone. That approach has flaws, though.**\n\n**I once spoke to a philanthropist who told me her earliest mistake was “sitting alone in a room, writing checks.” It was hard for her to trust people because everyone kept trying to get her money. Eventually, she realized isolation wasn’t serving her.**\n\n**Battery Powered is intended to help with that type of mistake. It’s a philanthropy community where people who are new to philanthropy mix with people who are more familiar with it, so they cross-pollinate and mentor each other. The BP staff — including you, Colleen — has several experts who research issues chosen by the members, and then vet organizations working on those issues. This gives members a chance to learn about the issues before they vote on which organizations get the money.**\n\nCOLLEEN: Exactly. The community aspect is unique. There are giving circles across the country — the trend is exploding — and they all have a social component to them, but we are large. We have 700 members! Battery Powered is also diverse in many ways, including age. We have members in their twenties and in their seventies.\n\nWe also have members who donate $4,000 per year, and other members who are much wealthier, who donate hundreds of thousands. I’ve asked all those different folks, why are you here? For individuals with smaller sums to give away, it gives them professional resources to help with their grantmaking that they wouldn’t otherwise have. For wealthier members — they already have their own large foundations with their own staff, dedicated to a specific mission, but they still care about other issues. So Battery Powered gives them a way to work on those other issues without diverting the whole structure and mission of their foundation.\n\n**LYDIA: You mentioned that giving circles are “exploding.”**\n\nCOLLEEN: People are motivated to give money in two main ways. One is that they received benefits from an organization, and they want to give back, like a hospital. The other is they get asked by a friend. This opens up a question: How do critically important things that people don’t touch on a day to day basis — or that their friends don’t touch — get funded?\n\nGiving circles are one way, which both solves this problem and helps people find community. A circle can be five acquaintances, or it can be as formalized as Battery Powered.\n\nI’m also excited about informational platforms, like the [Giving Compass](https://givingcompass.org/). Let’s say you’re interested in the issue of gun violence — if you put that into the Giving Compass website, it delivers a ton of information about relevant strategies and foundations.\n\nHopefully, in five years, we won’t be saying the main way people give is because they touched it or their friends ask them for it. It’ll be because they have more resources to investigate issues that they care about, that they think need to change, and to find good organizations working on those issues.\n\n**LYDIA: Are there other trends you’re excited about?**\n\nCOLLEEN: Young people in philanthropy. Look at climate change — Al Gore has been working on this for 30 years and the first time it started getting real, globally sustained activation was when students started striking!\n\nBattery Powered is about to start experimenting with youth philanthropy programs. Young people don’t need adults to give them a platform to organize; they should be teaching _us_ how to organize. Now I want to give them philanthropy in their toolbox, too. Young people still believe that they can change the world, and they’re right. A lot of people lose that belief as we get older, but young people are right. They can change the world.\n\n—\n\n•\n\nThanks for reading Solar Light! This post is public so feel free to share it.\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
