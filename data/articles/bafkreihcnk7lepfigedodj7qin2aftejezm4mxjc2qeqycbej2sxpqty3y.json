Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nThis year has felt like three years wrapped into just 365 days. From graduating from Hoggard High School in January, to the Berkshire Hathaway conference in April, to the Acquired podcast’s live show in New York, to starting college at UNC Charlotte and stepping into a new chapter filled with new friends, opportunities, and so much more.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Oe8f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa798dfdf-b802-487f-aa25-429011ea16fe_2047x1378.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Oe8f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa798dfdf-b802-487f-aa25-429011ea16fe_2047x1378.png)\n\n{{caption:Berkshire Hathaway 2025 Annual Meeting, Omaha, NE}}\n\nMost of all, I’m grateful for the opportunity to create AWM Financial and help thousands of students and young professionals prepare for a financial journey the world didn’t educate them for. That began with the AWM Financial Newsletter in July and expanded in September with the launch of the Beginner Money Meeting, a one-hour individual session focused on building a personalised plan for budgeting, saving, and investing with clear next steps toward specific financial goals.\n\nI’ve become a better writer, learned even more about personal finance, and have been welcomed into many wonderful communities while building my own and witnessing growth beyond anything I could’ve imagined. So thank you.\n\nWhile I remain skeptical of Substack’s analytics, somehow more than 2,000 people now read the AWM Financial Newsletter each month. That’s still hard for me to wrap my head around. As tempting as it is to gush with gratitude for another thousand words, I want to save some space for what’s ahead.\n\nThe Core Curriculum has matured into its teen years. While it’s still evolving, I genuinely believe it’s become a strong template to share budgeting, saving, and investing topics in a practical, approachable way. Watch Tower Wednesday has also been a meaningful series for me this year, as I’ve grown in my faith and, hopefully, my wisdom, and will also continue into 2026.\n\nI’m also excited to announce a new series: **The Capital Record**.\n\nThis is where I’ll go deeper into my actual portfolio. Expect in-depth company analysis, detailed income strategies, and more advanced investing discussions. Think of it as The Core Curriculum applied to the real world, from exciting milestones to realizing gains and losses (but hopefully not!), with my actual holdings updated every two weeks.\n\nThe best part? I already have the first significant research report ready to go, focused on an incredible business at a reasonable price, and I can’t wait to share it.\n\nWhile this new series will live behind a paywall, the first part of the company deep dive will be available for free. As always, Watch Tower Wednesday and The Core Curriculum will remain free and will likely be influenced by the decisions and lessons highlighted in The Capital Record.\n\n2026 is already shaping up to be an exciting year, and I can’t wait to share the nerdy statistics, ideas, and reader questions I’ve been saving up for the new year.\n\nHappy New Year,\n\nCrawford Anderson\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
