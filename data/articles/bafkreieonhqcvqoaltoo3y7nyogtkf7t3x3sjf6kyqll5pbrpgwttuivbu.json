  "body": "While Israel was bombing Gaza, another battlefront opened — the one on your phone.\nAccording to **U.S. Department of Justice filings**, Israel’s **Ministry of Diaspora Affairs** quietly funded a covert social-media campaign called the **“Esther Project.”**\n\nThe idea was simple — and chillingly effective.\nA Delaware-registered PR shell called **Bridges Partners LLC** received money from Israeli ministries, then paid **U.S. influencers** up to **$150,000 per month** to flood TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube with polished, “personal” pro-Israel content.\n\nThe influencers were given scripts about “hope,” “resilience,” and “humanity.” None were told that their creative briefs came straight from a government communication pipeline.\nMeanwhile, PR giants like **Havas Israel** and boutique U.S. agencies handled content scheduling, hashtags, and metrics — tracking engagement like a military campaign.\n\nWhen Meta’s security team finally caught traces of the network, they labeled it **“coordinated inauthentic behavior.”** But by then, millions of views had already been bought — and public opinion had been nudged without anyone realizing they were watching state-funded propaganda.\n\nThis short video breaks down how the _Esther Project_ blurred the line between **public diplomacy and psychological warfare**, and how algorithms became the new frontline of influence.\n\n[View Video](https://karat.substack.com/p/the-esther-files-inside-israels-covert)\n\n📌 Before you leave, if this piece gave you something to think about, please **restack it and share**. That one small act fuels this work and helps me keep writing the kind of content that builds the life you actually want to wake up to 🙏\n\n🎯 **Watch the 2-minute exposé:**\n<https://youtube.com/shorts/nxDtNEfZh2Y?feature=share>\n\n📚 **Read the full investigation:** <https://karat.substack.com/p/israel-secretly-paid-us-influencers>\n\nBecause wars today aren’t just fought with bombs —\nthey’re fought with _reels, hashtags,_ and _invoices._",
