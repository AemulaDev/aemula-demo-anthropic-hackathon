That’s exactly what just happened to me. My new boss goes by the nickname Gcal, and he, or I should say it, loves working me like a dog.\n\nOf course, I’m not talking about a person, but rather my Google Calendar, which I blindly follow to remember when, where, and what I should be doing.\n\nHomework, class times, business calls, club meetings. Even the hangouts my friends thought were spontaneous had been on my calendar for weeks.\n\nLast week in, _[“Earn Cashback Without a Credit Card”](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/earn-cashback-without-a-credit-card?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, we talked about optimizing for an extra layer that benefits you financially. This week, we discuss how optimizing your time can multiply your productivity. You likely don’t need every tool here, just what makes your week easier.\n\n**Where my week starts to fall apart**\n\nIt’s Monday morning, January 12, the first day of a brand-new semester at UNC Charlotte. It’s pretty cold out, about 41°, and I forgot to walk to my classes before they started. Oops. Off to a bad start already. The night before, I ignored my calendar notification scheduled for 11 PM to wind down and sleep. The option was provided, but I just neglected it.\n\nMy first class was at 2:30 PM, yes, you’re reading that right. It was in Woodward Hall, and despite not touring the campus the day before to get a feel for where my classes were, I had thankfully added the class time, location, room number, and professor’s name directly into my calendar.\n\nAll of my college classes are added to my school Google account, making it easy to integrate class schedules into the calendar. Occasionally, classes move online, which lets me link a Zoom or, even better, a Google Meet link directly into the calendar.\n\nIf you’ve ever seen The Lord of the Rings, you know about the one ring to rule them all. For my classes, each gets one doc to rule them all. A master Google Doc that contains all the information relevant to the class, along with my notes for each lecture session. That one doc gets automatically linked to every instance of the class on my calendar, allowing one-click teleportation to all relevant class notes.\n\nEveryone dreads the flood of emails in the first week of a new semester. Every class, club, and student organization posts beginning-of-year updates and schedules. Thankfully, with Gemini integrated into Gmail, I can add events directly to my calendar with a single click. A huge time saver when 50+ emails by 9 AM take up way too much mental space.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ko4l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F797e3127-078b-4617-a772-4ba75b69f5f8_1416x705.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ko4l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F797e3127-078b-4617-a772-4ba75b69f5f8_1416x705.png)\n\n{{caption:One click add to Calendar in Gmail, with the agenda feature}}\n\nSpeaking of mental load, it’s important to carve out time for yourself. On my calendar, lavender indicates protected free time. Laundry, dorm cleanup, or simply relaxing, of course, downtime is scheduled!\n\nIt may seem insane to schedule freedom, but it works for me.\n\nAnother mental-load reducer is my Bible studies, Christian campus events, and church on Sunday morning. Beyond just reminders, Google Maps integration automatically populates the address when I enter the name of the building or church. I can even get a “leave now” notification based on current traffic conditions. The color yellow indicates church activities and stands out prominently against my calendar’s dark mode.\n\nGoing back to school-focused activities, on Tuesday the 13th, I was tabling for the Investment Club. That event gets the distinct color purple, indicating high priority. The same color is used for Investment Club leadership meetings and Niner Times editor sessions. The color protects the time required for essential commitments.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, I had a one-hour Google Meet for my business, which lives on my work email and syncs with my personal Google account. I can toggle it on or off in my calendar, and it has its own color, an integrated Meet link, and call notes.\n\n**How I keep everything from colliding**\n\nTuesday nights are newsletter writing nights, marked in orange as protected time. A lunch with a friend on Wednesday, the 14th, is marked in purple as a high-priority event.\n\nAnother campus activity that day is marked dark green, indicating medium priority. Lighter green represents low-priority campus events. The ability to customize colors makes it easy to understand the week at a glance.\n\nPink indicates personal time in the morning and evening. Bible study, my morning routine, and evening wind-down all live there.\n\nFriday is a workday, indicated by graphite, which highlights sales shifts or gig hours. But I can still drag and drop time blocks to make room for a workout at the gym, which is marked blue.\n\nThroughout the week, I have over a dozen tasks that must be done on certain days, sometimes at specific times. These are easy to add as all-day tasks or time-blocked items like 12 PM.\n\nMy school email also integrates with my personal Google Calendar, which serves as the hub for all events. Canvas syncs as well, importing homework, assignments, class updates, and project deadlines directly into the calendar for easy digestion.\n\nAnother key integration is the Investment Club’s semester master calendar, which includes regular meetings, advanced meetings, and special events. I can toggle it on or off as needed.\n\n**What I changed this semester**\n\nThis semester, I changed my strategy. Instead of forcing everything into my one personal calendar, I use the share calendar feature. My work email, university email, and personal calendars are shared, but can be toggled on or off depending on the view I need. Tasks can also be hidden or isolated.\n\nI import university academic calendars, which I usually keep off but occasionally check. I also use add-on calendars for U.S. holidays and birthdays imported from contacts.\n\nMy personal favorite integration is Stock Events, my portfolio management software. It imports earnings reports, ex-dividend dates, and dividend payment dates directly into my Google Calendar, letting me see what’s happening in my portfolio during the week.\n\nRecently, I started using the Gcal booking feature, which lets me share a link showing my availability for 30-minute or one-hour meetings, either in person or via Meets. Others can schedule time without seeing the details of my calendar.\n\nI often confuse days, locations, or class times. Being able to pull out Google Calendar, click once, and see where I need to go, when to leave, and relevant notes is invaluable. It also keeps me focused, with a clear countdown to the next block of time.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v1Hm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa59fca24-2a37-4657-ab31-6bd356744f24_1009x484.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v1Hm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa59fca24-2a37-4657-ab31-6bd356744f24_1009x484.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:My calendar, blurred slightly for privacy}}\n\nGoogle Calendar integrates across devices seamlessly. My computer and iPad display my weekly schedule by default, while my phone shows my daily schedule. My Apple Watch sends notifications for when to leave or where to go.\n\nBetween weird biweekly meetings, reminders to cancel streaming services, weekly class notes, and 30-minute alerts before events, I’d probably fall apart if Google Calendar went down tomorrow.\n\nTime is the most valuable resource we have. You can’t get it back. Another 30 minutes of TikTok might be tempting, but it’s rarely the best use of time. Thankfully, breaks are scheduled too.\n\nMost first-year students, and probably sophomores as well, don’t yet have the same time commitments. But leadership roles, becoming an RA, or more challenging classes will push mental tracking to the limit.\n\nMy Google Calendar setup works for me. It wouldn’t work for everyone. That’s why customization, from colors to time blocks to background modes, matters so much.\n\nI’d keep writing, but my boss is calling, and I have to go.\n\n_Got questions, disagreements, or a money topic you want broken down next?_\n\n_Shoot me an email at_ _<Crawford@awmfinancial.net>_ _or visit awmfinancial.net._\n\n_This content is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.
