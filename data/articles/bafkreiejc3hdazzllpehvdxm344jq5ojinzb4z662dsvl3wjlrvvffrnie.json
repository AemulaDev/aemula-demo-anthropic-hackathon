  "body": "This is part III of a series exploring how we can combat the Trust Apocalypse by building a catalytic community:\n\n- [Part I: What is a Catalytic Community?](https://aemula.com/platform/article/bafkreialrry37qdsuownvhu6kwfqy7b7yjpg7nsbhh7vocmqp6mpnomexu)\n- [Part II: Catalytic Community Evolution-From Connection to Impact](https://aemula.com/platform/article/bafkreidfqsbqtza2qqjxwwpsccsduq56kbnatp2uybj3phegmky2y2pfge)\n\n***\n\nEvery catalytic community begins intentionally-with clear objectives, careful stakeholder selection, and deliberate steps toward building lasting relationships. The initial phase of community formation sets the tone, expectations, and operational norms that guide all subsequent collaboration.\n\nThe Trust Foundation's immediate focus is hosting our inaugural trust gathering later this year in Washington, D.C.-to be co-hosted in partnership with General Stan McChrystal and the McChrystal Group (underscoring our ethos of trust-based leadership). We have identified key stakeholder groups-including scholars who study societal change, community organizers on the front lines, tech innovators focused on trust, public officials open to new approaches, philanthropic investors, and media leaders-and are actively working to convene these diverse actors. The unifying element is our shared higher purpose: **to preserve for our children and grandchildren communities and institutions worthy of their trust**. Making that purpose explicit is the first step. As network specialists often say, \"Start with why.\" We will articulate a clear and ambitious mission statement (co-created with initial members) that inspires commitment and also clarifies what this community is not (to manage scope).\n\nThe inaugural convening will not be your typical top-down conference. Instead, it will be highly participatory design sessions where stakeholders collectively explore \"where to begin.\" The primary outcome of the first convening will be a collaboratively drafted roadmap of priority initiatives and task forces. Borrowing a term from the military, we aim to establish a \"battle rhythm\" for the community-a regular cadence of interaction and decision-making. For example, we might set up a monthly virtual town hall for all members, biweekly coordination calls for task force leads, and an online platform for ongoing discussion and data sharing. This rhythm creates a heartbeat for the network so that communication remains fluid. As General McChrystal found, a frequent shared forum (in his case, a daily Operations and Intelligence briefing) can align even thousands of distributed operators and \"*pump information and context*\" throughout the organization. In our context, a well-designed engagement structure ensures that a community spanning many professions and locales can still think and act together as one.\n\nEqually important in the initiation phase is trust-building among members. Many of these actors may be strangers to each other or even wary due to their different backgrounds. To accelerate relationship-building, we will incorporate exercises and norms to \"cultivate trust\" from the outset. This includes small-group breakouts, facilitated dialogues that allow for the honest airing of concerns (operating under Chatham House rules to encourage candor), and ample informal social time to foster human connections.\n\nResearch on network formation suggests that acknowledging differences but finding early \"quick wins\" in understanding can bond a group. For instance, ahead of the convening, we might anonymously poll attendees to surface areas of agreement. We expect that while a tech CEO and a community activist might diverge on tactics, both could strongly agree on a statement like \"everyone deserves a voice and respect\"-highlighting shared values. From such common ground, we craft a shared narrative for the group.\n\nFinally, we will establish a tone that this is a decentralized, co-owned community from the outset. One tactic will be to invite volunteers for various steward roles at the first convening (e.g., facilitation team, communications liaison, \"network weavers\" who connect people with common interests). By distributing responsibilities and visibly empowering attendees, we signal trust. Another tactic will be to develop a simple community charter together-a set of guiding principles that everyone commits to (e.g., \"Trust, transparency, inclusion, action-orientation\"). This charter serves as a foundation for accountability and culture. In summary, the initial phase involves seeding the network with purpose, people, and practices. If we get this right, we will have a solid foundation: a core group united by trust and ready to collaborate, an agreed mission and engagement plan, and early momentum from collectively charting our course.\n\n\"*Growing the network at the speed of trust,*\" as we like to say, is both the aim and the challenge. We won't rush it, and we will be intentional about it; the table is being set for a powerful, catalytic community-now it's time to build the information and relationship infrastructure that will enable it to thrive.\n\n***\n\nComing Soon: Part IV: Building the Information & Relationship Foundation\n\n***\n\n*To read more and support or subscribe directly, find all the Trust Apocalypse work on [Substack](https://trustapocalypse.substack.com/).*",
