  "preview": "How we might avoid toxic polarization",
  "body": "Over the Christmas holiday, I got myself a copy of Zachary Elwood’s book _Defusing American Anger: A Guide to Understanding Our Fellow Citizens and Reducing Us-Vs-Them Polarization_.\n\nI read through the book over the last several days and finished it last night.\n\nI highly recommend this book. It is well worth the time spent reading it.\n\nThere is one small issue that I have with the book that I will discuss later, but overall, I think Elwood’s work is excellent.\n\nThe first section of the book deals with the idea of toxic polarization: what it is, how it spreads, who it empowers, and how it hurts us as a country. Elwood describes toxic polarization as the tendency to sort ourselves into two opposing groups who fear and show contempt for each other. He says that it is our nature to sort ourselves into groups with differing values and priorities, but this becomes a problem when we see members of the opposing group as contemptible. Rather than assigning blame to one particular group, he says that both groups are to blame and contribute to a feedback loop that intensifies toxic polarization.\n\nWhile it might seem like avoiding toxic polarization means that we should not have strong political convictions, Elwood would disagree with that. He says it’s quite possible to work towards political goals while avoiding insults, and also adds that treating others with respect is more likely to lead to better results. Additionally, he repeatedly emphasizes that toxic polarization can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and also how polarization can make even would-be allies distrustful of each other.\n\nThe second section is the longer section of the book, and examines polarization across a variety of issues, including immigration, racism, abortion, distrust in elections, Trump, guns, social media use, and several others. While Elwood describes his own views, he spends more time examining what each side is saying, often including perspectives from groups that don’t fit the expected narrative on such issues to show that the issues are not as simple as they appear, and that reasonable people could land on both sides.\n\nI agree with most of what Elwood says in his book, especially the first part (I would land in different places from him on multiple issues in the second part, but I can see where he is coming from on those issues). Toxic polarization and contempt are harmful, even if warranted (and they sometimes seem to be). They should be a last resort, if we use them at all. Many of the articles on my Substack echo what Elwood says repeatedly in his book: that we should represent each other accurately and charitably, even and especially when we disagree.\n\nWhere I would part ways with Elwood is on face-to-face vs. written communication. When discussing social media, Elwood says that writing makes us more entrenched in our views and that the lack of face-to-face interactions makes it more likely for us to act toward one another in dehumanizing and callous ways. I don’t consider Elwood’s account of social media to be incorrect as much as it is incomplete. He has certainly done his homework on this, and has cited quite a few sources, for which I commend him.\n\nYet face-to-face conversations are vulnerable to interruption, and people who may have something they want to say may not get a chance to say it before the subject changes or the conversation ends. This can lead to people feeling like they were deliberately ignored, which is its own source of animosity. In contrast, being able to write a social media post on a topic can make a person feel heard, even if it doesn’t get that much attention.\n\nI wonder how much of the polarization we observe can be attributed to people just trying to get others’ attention. One reason often given for the increase in mass shootings is the notoriety given to the shooter. In other words, the shooter becomes “known,” and people pay attention to him (shooters are almost always male). Similarly, for people who are ignored or isolated to begin with, finding like-minded individuals online makes them feel heard and seen. There have been times when I have not been able to participate meaningfully in a discussion due to either being interrupted or having the conversation end or change subjects before I could speak; the fact that I can share my views online and have others react has given me a feeling of having found “my people”. I’ve written an article on what I value about social media in [this article](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/being-heard-and-feeling-valued), and there are others where I discuss it in passing.\n\nAt the same time, not all written posts are equally helpful. As I said earlier, I think that Elwood’s account is incomplete, not incorrect. Many social media posts do not take care to understand one’s opponents or to represent them fairly. Care should be exercised in written communication to represent one’s opponents accurately and charitably, and should note points of agreement as well as disagreement. I think we take agreement too much for granted, and with the “negativity bias” that Elwood mentions in his book, we should make more of an effort to note points of agreement with those we otherwise disagree with.\n\nOverall, _Defusing American Anger_ is a book that I highly recommend for everyone. I personally found it to be helpful in my own thinking on many social issues of our day as well as the issue of polarization in general.",
