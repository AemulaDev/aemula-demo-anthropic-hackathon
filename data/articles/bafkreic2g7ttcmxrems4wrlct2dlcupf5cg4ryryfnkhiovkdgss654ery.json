He’d flown in from Indiana the night before, missed a connection in Newark, and caught the first train from Union Station that morning. He owns a small company that imports STEM toys—wooden blocks, tactile math puzzles, bilingual learning kits—from a factory in Shenzhen he’s used for over a decade. Customs paperwork used to take an hour. Now it’s a migraine. Ever since the new 10 percent tariff blanketed nearly every import, his warehouse margins haven’t just thinned—they’ve evaporated.\n\nHe isn’t a plaintiff in the case. But he came to hear it argued, because what happens in that chamber could decide whether he’s still in business by Christmas.\n\nThe courtroom doors opened precisely at 9:55 a.m., and by 10:00 the justices were seated. The first lawyer stood. It was Neal Katyal, representing a coalition of small businesses, a dozen states, and trade associations rarely seen on the same docket. He didn’t start with theory. He started with clarity.\n\n“Tariffs are taxes,” he said. “And the president cannot rewrite the tax code by proclamation.”¹\n\nThe sound system buzzed faintly, amplifying the weight behind every word. No one in the room missed the implication: the president had, without a single vote in Congress, imposed a ten‑percent tax on almost every product entering the United States. What began as retaliation against rising Chinese imports and political pressure to “protect American jobs” had expanded into a global duty system by executive order.\n\nAcross the lectern, D. John Sauer—arguing for the administration—rose with equal confidence. “This authority derives from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,” he said, “and from longstanding national‑security statutes.” He invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the same law presidents have used to shield the steel and aluminum industries. Emergencies don’t wait for committee votes, he argued, and this one—economic manipulation by hostile actors—was already in motion.\n\nKatyal didn’t flinch. If Congress truly meant to give the president power to rewrite tariffs, he said, it would have said so clearly. IEEPA was designed in 1977 to let presidents freeze assets and block wire transfers from hostile regimes, not redesign the import structure of the entire economy.\n\n“IEEPA is a scalpel for emergencies,” Katyal said, “not a chainsaw for the tariff code.”¹\n\nThat line hit like a dropped gavel. Justice Kagan scribbled something. Gorsuch leaned forward. Even Chief Justice Roberts narrowed his eyes when Sauer pressed the argument that the phrase _economic measures_ covered nearly everything the president had done.\n\n“If IEEPA permits a ten‑percent baseline duty on nearly everything,” Justice Barrett asked, “what’s to stop twenty? Or fifty? Or a permanent tariff regime?”²\n\nHer tone wasn’t hypothetical. It was structural.\n\nTo readers, the difference between these statutes can sound academic. But it’s the difference between checks and silence. The Trade Act delegates authority under congressional oversight; IEEPA lets a president act alone during a declared emergency. This case asks whether that emergency power can permanently replace legislative will.\n\nWhile the lawyers sparred, the consequences were already unfolding far from Washington. In East Boothbay, Maine, the Winfield Boat Company had just paid six dollars more per square foot for marine‑grade aluminum than it did in March. “We’ll eat that cost through the winter,” said Sam Ellis, a fourth‑generation shipwright. “But by spring, we’re either raising prices or laying someone off.”\n\nIn Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a brewery known for its witbier had quietly dropped two can sizes—aluminum tariffs hit both sheets and lids. In Burlington, Vermont, a Korean‑hybrid dealership was running exclusively on pre‑orders. “We can’t warehouse cars we don’t know how to price,” said the manager. “The tariffs move faster than the software.”³\n\n“We just need rules we can plan around,” he added, shaking his head. “That’s it.”³\n\nBack inside, Sauer circled back to principle. Emergencies justify decisive action. But several justices pressed the definition itself. What emergency? And how long does it last? IEEPA requires a declared national emergency—but this one had been in place for nearly a year and renewed twice. It began as a currency issue, morphed into an opioid crisis response, and by fall had become a catch‑all for “foreign disrespect.” The Court smelled drift.\n\n“If an ‘emergency’ can last as long as it is useful,” Justice Jackson asked, “then hasn’t the exception become the rule?”⁴\n\nHer voice wasn’t angry. Just weary, like someone who’d read this script before.\n\nOutside the courthouse, the line moved through drizzle. A man from the American Apparel Importers Council explained the case to a woman who sold Turkish linen at a farmer’s market. A 70‑year‑old winemaker from Quebec, whose U.S. orders had dropped forty percent, held her printed pass like a ticket to a verdict.\n\nThat floor‑polish smell from inside clung faintly to her scarf, mingled now with wet newspaper, road salt, and the cinnamon tang of someone’s thermos steaming near the barricades. It was the scent of government—sterile, persistent, impossible to wash out.\n\nLegal observers had warned this was coming. In June, the Federal Circuit wrote: “You don’t get to declare an emergency and create a new tax system.”⁵ The government appealed, and the Supreme Court accepted it on fast‑track. SCOTUSblog called it “the most consequential separation‑of‑powers test since the New Deal.”⁶\n\nThen came the history lesson: tariffs as political fire. The 1828 “Tariff of Abominations” nearly split the union; Hoover’s Smoot‑Hawley Tariff in 1930 worsened the Great Depression and provoked global retaliation. Those laws came through Congress. This one arrived by signature.\n\n“A baseline ten percent on nearly every import is not crisis management,” Justice Sotomayor said. “It’s a new tariff code.”⁷\n\nBy the time the gavel dropped, the marble was quiet again. Lawyers zipped their bags. Reporters closed laptops. The man in the black coat lingered on the steps. His phone buzzed—a new message from Shenzhen. His supplier had raised its minimum order size. If the tariff stayed, he was finished.\n\nHe didn’t speak. He hadn’t spoken all morning. But the air around him still smelled like floor polish and wet wool.\n\nIt wasn’t just his business at stake.\n\nIt was a question of constitutional power.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
