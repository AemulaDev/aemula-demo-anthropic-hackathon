  "body": "On Election Night, let’s talk about why Republicans keep losing elections in places that used to be winnable. There’s the obvious elephant in the room– Trump as a specter in moderate and swing voters’ minds (Ambivalent Right, Stressed Sideliners, and Democratic Mainstays)-- but I want to dig a little deeper than that, into the current makeup of the Republican Party. We talked in an earlier column about the different factions as identified by Pew Research. I argue that the Party is now divided into at least three contradictory factions with [around 28% being “Only Trump” voters](https://www.thebulwark.com/exclusive-bulwark-poll-most-republicans-want-to-move-on-from-trump/) who should be more accurately thought of as Outsider Left instead of Populist Right. Until the Party rediscovers unifying principles, it is no more likely to succeed than the left’s “coalition of the ascendant” was after Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nThe three contradictory factions are the ones active in Republican politics because they’re the ones that vote in primary elections and at caucuses: Committed Conservatives, Faith and flag Conservatives, and Populist Right (Outsider Left). The first group and about half of the second group refused to vote for Donald Trump in 2016, while the final group voted Republican for the first time between 2012 and 2016, enthusiastically supporting Donald Trump in primaries and the general election. The first group mostly begrudgingly voted for Trump in 2020 and maintained their philosophical convictions, while the latter two groups became virtually indistinguishable in their rhetoric and voting habits. However, there are notable differences between them that cause additional intra-party struggles.\n\nFirst, on issues, Faith and Flag Conservatives are still ultimately a small-government, religious, pro-military faction. They’re mostly working-class though, which means they feel a greater relationship and share more vocabulary and tone with the Populist Right (Outsider Left) than with the Committed Conservatives who resemble them more closely in ideology. Historically, this faction has clashed with other Republican factions over tactics, believing that outspoken ideological commitment is either more important than or required to win elections. In contrast, other factions have historically supported more moderate or pragmatic candidates, especially in swing races. As they’ve aligned with the Populist Right (Outsider Left), my experience has been that as individuals, they are more likely than ever to recognize the need to speak the language of the median voter to win.\n\nThough it employs the same rhetoric as the Faith and Flag Conservatives (intra-party opponents are “establishment RINOs” that “don’t fight”), the current iteration of the Populist Right directly disagrees with Faith and Flag Conservatives about what the phrase means. To the average Faith and Flag conservative, an “establishment RINO” is a Republican who is too moderate/squishy and unwilling to be outspoken on issues like abortion and gender-affirming healthcare for kids. To the average Populist Right Republican an “establishment RINO” is someone too willing to speak the language of the median voter, too “nice” and unwilling to “be mean” like Trump in general. As individuals, Populist Right and Faith and Flag Conservatives both want to win elections but disagree about how to do it even though they use the same words: “Fight for WE THE PEOPLE against the DEEP STATE OF ESTABLISHMENT RINOS!” Also, many Populist Right (recently Outsider Left) Republicans are not ideologically conservative. They share other Republicans' opposition to intersectional ideology but mostly because it harms them, not because they're committed individualists or communalists. They oppose free trade because they believe it has harmed their economic prospects. They're concerned about green energy sources because environmental activism continues to destroy the jobs many of them rely upon and sometimes their ability to build homes and manage their personal property. They're reactionary-- they don't believe in principled fights, they believe being \"as mean as the Left\" is the only way to win. They have no knowledge of political history (but negative vibes!) and are extremely pessimistic about the future. \n\nThe Populist Right (Outsider Left) faction and Faith and Flag Conservatives make strange bedfellows but together, they represent between a significant plurality and a majority of the Party depending on the region. In many places, it's possible to retain the principled soul of conservatism within the Republican Party but we have to fight for it!\n\n\\*\\*You Can Improve It!\n\\*\\*If you’re Ambivalent Right or a Stressed Sideliner, you need to caucus with Republicans in your state for someone other than Trump. I’m team Nikki Haley but beginning with your local precinct caucuses (which might be as early as January!) you MUST show up and send delegates to your county convention, then others from your county convention to the state convention who will support a presidential candidate who isn’t Donald Trump. That, not primary elections, is the process to influence the Republican presidential nominee in many states! When you don’t show up and participate, activists just assume that you don’t care that much about changing the outcome! We need all of you!\n\nYou can also advocate for better politics in the Party Platform. Braver Angels will soon have a suggested platform item and resolution that you can ask your local and state parties to adopt that promotes healthy conflict and better disagreement.\n\nIn conclusion, the Parties need all their voters to steer in a different direction. Only healthy engagement with the conflict rather than avoidance will steer our political culture back toward the pluralistic ideals that make our country great.",
