  "body": "Last week, Jonah Goldberg did an admirable job of defining the three major types of “conservatives,” concluding that one of them is [actually not conservative at all](https://thedispatch.com/article/conservative-right-wing-terms-history-maga/). That, on top of many conversations with friends and colleagues over the last few years, inspired me to write this week on the factions currently with the Republican Party. In the “bridging,” “depolarization,” or “pro-democracy” spaces, where people don’t have open disdain for Republicans (except Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger) there’s sometimes instead a dismissive attitude toward Republicans who aren’t MAGA stereotypes. People imagine that there are MAGA Republicans and moderates; if you’re not an angry MAGA stereotype, you’re just a moderate, and people assume they understand moderate Republicans and that they mostly didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nLet me break your assumptions.\n\nI’m going to begin by summarizing Jonah’s piece on conservatism, because I think it is a helpful framework and I’ll discuss how people within the factions fit to these types.\n\n1. Ideological conservatism: A philosophical tradition that observes imperfect human nature and provides a framework for flourishing within it that rests on protection of individual “natural rights” that pre-exist government. Unlike other ideologies, it harnesses human self-interest and promotes the practice of virtuous self-governance instead of seeking to perfect society. Key figures include John Stuart Mill, John Locke, Adam Smith, and Edmund Burke.\n\n2. Dispositional conservatism: An attitude that views change with skepticism, concerned with the problem of “Chesterton’s Fence,” which expresses the idea that most things have purpose, sometimes a different and more positive purpose from the one for which they were originally instituted. Those things, like a fence, should not be torn down without understanding the reason for their construction and continued existence. People who place a high value on knowledge, experience, tradition, institutions, or ritual are often dispositional conservatives even when they are not Republican.\n\n3. Populist Front/New Right/Woke Right: The opposite of dispositional conservatism because it wants to burn down institutions and take control for itself, and ideological conservatism because it opposes the virtue of restraint through self-government and believes it is capable of perfecting society by force. It has no real leaders; only influencers leading from behind. This is actually a type of Republican, not a type of conservatism.\n\nAll these kinds of conservatism exist across multiple factions within the current Republican Party, plus there are Republicans who are not conservative, and Trump voters who are not otherwise Republicans (do not support down-ballot Republicans and only like Trump). For this piece, I will not be discussing influencers as fitting into factions, because I don’t believe most do. Instead of relying solely on my own experiences and brain, I’m going to use the factions described by Pew Research in 2021. Though it’s my sense that percentages have shifted quite a lot since then and I think the descriptions have some as well, I think the groups are generally correct.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fA8_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9be0757-4dcb-4b85-8b67-3252a250e3a1_760x1372.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fA8_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9be0757-4dcb-4b85-8b67-3252a250e3a1_760x1372.png)\n\n1. **Faith and Flag Conservatives**, Pew Research correctly notes, strongly support President Trump. However, this group is also _mostly_ dispositional conservatives. If there’s a group that you think of when you hear “evangelical,” it should be this group. Because Christians believe in a sin nature that can’t be perfected, they are also natural ideological conservatives, but many of them are more connected with the Republican Party due to its historical opposition to abortion and support for religious freedom. Though they’re mostly older, you should know that this group is pretty racially and socioeconomically diverse. Faith and Flag voters are likely to say that they are “Christian conservatives” and though the percentage of Black Faith & Flag voters is extremely small, it’s not unusual to see a variety of first and second generation immigrants fall into this category, including Ukrainians, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and Catholic immigrants from many different countries. Faith and Flag Conservatives are mostly dispositional conservatives who view Democratic policies (especially abortion and support for gender transition of children) as directly conflicting with their faith. They almost universally voted for Trump after organizing for Ted Cruz in 2016, and many supported Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum in 2012 before falling in line for Mitt Romney. They were reluctant Trump voters in 2016 because of his immorality, but became enthusiastic supporters with the appointment of pro-life Supreme Court justices. Some consider themselves single-issue voters on the issue of abortion. Because this group is mostly older, they often adopt talking points from Fox News and consequently, have disparate views on when and whether we should intervene in given conflicts. However, this faction also includes an extremely high percentage of military veterans and they’re old enough that they still strongly fear Communism, support free trade, and support defending our global allies. They enthusiastically voted for Trump, reflexively support DOGE, want to stop activist progressive judges, and worry about media bias, which is ironic, because this faction is most heavily ensconced in a Republican media bubble.\n\n2. **Committed Conservatives** are the faction most similar to me. These are ideological and dispositional conservatives within the Republican Party. They were often Never Trump in 2016, mostly voted for him in 2020, and may or may not have voted for him in 2024. This faction has never been enthusiastic about Trump, but they are _are not remotely ideologically moderate._ They often self-describe as “small-l” libertarians (supportive of a much smaller and more limited government than we have, plus strongly support separation of powers and robust federalism), are mostly pro-life, but are also usually pragmatic and solutions-oriented in their policy approaches. They admire Ronald Reagan’s commitment to free trade around the world, embrace his 80/20 rule (“The person who agrees with you 80% of the time is 80% your friend, not 20% your enemy), and mostly support Teddy Roosevelt’s famous foreign policy approach, “Talk softly and carry a big stick.” Essentially all Federalist Society attorneys are Committed Conservatives (excepting the ones who have split off to Common Good Constitutionalism). They strongly support legal immigration while opposing illegal immigration. They place a high value on experience, knowledge, and Truth and a lower value on credentialism. Statistically, they’re the best educated Republican faction… and oppose identity politics (“wokeness”) as vociferously as any other faction in the Party. This faction, though, is kept awake at night by process violations and actions motivated by personal animus that could prevent policy wins. They love science but hate scientism. They love vaccines and hate mandates. They love education and hate seeing it used to misinform. This faction includes people from a variety of faith backgrounds and of no faith at all. Their news diet is well-educated and ideologically diverse, and they talk a blue streak about media bias. They have a favorite Wall Street Journal columnist, subscribe to the Free Press, and love to hate the New York Times. In summary, they’re the most ideologically conservative faction. However, they are sometimes derided as moderates or Republicans in Name Only (RINOs). The Populist Right sees them as disloyal because they are committed to enduring principles instead of personalities, because they support traditional and alternative education routes, and because they are dispositional conservatives, while Democrats see them as moderates because they’re dispositional conservatives who are willing to openly oppose Trump.\n\n3. The **Populist Right** is an amalgam of people who are mostly Republicans because of their severe antipathy toward the identity politics of the progressive left, also known as negative polarization. You might think of them as bottom-of-the-horseshoe swing voters. This faction is also marked by an intuitional or ideological affinity toward zero-sum thinking, making them economic leftists. They are not dispositional or ideological conservatives, and they see dispositional and ideological conservatives as disloyal elites, but their policy preferences nonetheless sometimes dovetail. If you’re thinking about a Venn diagram, Committed Conservatives and the Populist Right overlap in opposing intersectional Marxism and other leftist critical theories. The Populist Right, however, embraces its own equal and opposite critical theory, while Committed Conservatives oppose all forms of identity politics. This faction includes:\n\n   1. Christian Nationalists and Catholic Integrationalists (think of them as economically liberal, socially conservative authoritarians)\n\n   2. unChristian Nationalists (for more on this faction, see my [pieces](https://understandingpolitics.substack.com/p/horseshoe-theory-zero-sum-thinking) on [Woke Right](https://understandingpolitics.substack.com/p/woke-right-part-ii))\n\n   3. MAGA Left (see: Batya Ungar Sargon & rural, non-agricultural, blue-collar, pro-Big Labor Americans)\n\n4. The **Ambivalent Right** and **Stressed Sideliners** are both moderate factions. The Ambivalent Right, a younger faction, should not be mistaken as non-Trump voters or anti-Trump voters because they’d prefer Trump not remain in politics. Rather, these are Republicans who mostly lack ideological mooring but who are younger dispositional conservatives. They think Trump is too old to be president, but they’re too anti-woke to vote for Kamala Harris. They pretty much all voted for Trump, without much hesitation. They grew up in the age of Trump and don’t know a politics before the attention economy. Trump is their normal candidate. Their biggest concern is the economy… and they’re largely economically illiterate. They don’t like abortion… and they feel bad about opposing it. They think there should be less illegal immigration… and they feel compassion for good people being deported. These are often younger, urbanite Republicans who joined for the counter-culture that feels freer, healthier, and more normal than the stultifying circles of progressivism, but not oppositional defiance.\n\n5. **Stressed Sideliners** are an endangered species where I live in Washington state and are the faction of Republican voters least likely to have voted for Trump. These are your normal moderate swing voters. Ideologically unmoored, intuitionally economically liberal (pro-capitalism), dispositional conservatives, this faction just wants to vote for someone, anyone who feels like a normal, responsible adult. In a pre-Trump era, they often voted for split government in Blue states, feeling like both sides would govern in too extreme of a way unless they had to share power. Very few of this faction voted for Trump and many who did felt as though they were under extreme duress in making that choice.\n\nIn conclusion, except for the Stressed Sideliners, almost all of these factions voted for Trump at least once and most of them voted for him two or three times. The MAGA-identitarian faction is comparatively small, but noisy on Twitter. If what you want is to understand Trump voters, seeking a MAGA stereotype expresses closed-minded stereotyping more than open curiosity. If you’re a Democrat, it’s like looking for a DSA member to help you understand the average Kamala Harris voter. The Republican Party is an extremely broad faction that includes conservatives and non-conservatives, moderates from the top and bottom of the horseshoe, and Libertarians, people with all levels (from open rejection to idolization) of affinity for Trump, and they have nearly all been Trump voters. Right now, there is a big tent party— the GOP.",
