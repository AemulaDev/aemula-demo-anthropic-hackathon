  "body": "Having been away from social media and blogging for a few days due to [a little family event](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/a-homily), I opened my laptop on Monday and checked in on X (_do I have to say “formerly Twitter” anymore?_). I was surprised to see “Grassley” trending. While the 91-year-old senior Senator and President Pro Tempore (third in line to the presidency) is prolific on X - one of the few Senators who does most of his own posts, they’re not the kind that usually make X’s “_What’s Happening_” section.\n\nWas it because the Senator and Barbara Grassley just celebrated their 71st wedding anniversary? Or were they mesmerized by his tweets posts on Iowa’s corn harvest?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-_ny!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F268920d2-1d24-4f97-8c5e-1a13ddd0135b_670x761.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-_ny!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F268920d2-1d24-4f97-8c5e-1a13ddd0135b_670x761.jpeg)\n\nNope. It was because President Trump not only criticized the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee over his not ditching the century-old “blue slip” custom, but also unleashed the MAGAverse on the good Senator from the Hawkeye State.\n\n_Lay off, everyone_. Senator Grassley knows what he’s doing. You aren’t accomplishing _anything_. Trust me on this. Grassley isn’t worried about his political standing back home, and you’re not only way off target, but ignoring all the good he’s doing in support of the Trump agenda (at least the good parts).\n\nI’m not defending US Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) because he’s my friend, nor because his wife, Barbara, just celebrated their anniversary last Friday. I’ve not only traveled with Senator and Mrs. Grassley on Senate business in the past, but I also hosted his monthly cable television show, “_[Ask Your Senator](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/friday-september-15-2000)_,” on Iowa cable outlets for 15 years. Of course, I deeply admire and respect him. You would, too, if you knew him like I do.\n\nI don’t think he’s running anymore, but on his 81st birthday, he celebrated a pre-dawn “[home to the dome](https://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/218012-grassley-marks-81st-birthday-with-6-mile-run/)” run from his Arlington, Virginia, townhouse to the US Capitol, a 6.2-mile trot. He’s the real deal.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QUy0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecbece78-eab5-4bb6-a300-a12c09cbe029_644x363.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QUy0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecbece78-eab5-4bb6-a300-a12c09cbe029_644x363.jpeg)\n\n*I want to be like Senator Chuck Grassley when I grow up.*\n\nWhile I don’t always agree with his policies (see: renewable fuels), he remains a force of nature at age 91 (he turns 92 on September 17th). He may be nearly a decade older than former President Joe Biden, but his intellectual prowess has long surpassed that of his former and obviously infirm colleague. Elected to the Senate in 1980 after a brief career in the US House, where I first met him, I can attest that Senator Grassley can’t be pushed around. He can be as obstinate as . . . an Iowa farmer. _Which he is_.\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ss2P8QDpcw)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ss2P8QDpcw) *[Grassley Works for Iowa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ss2P8QDpcw)*\n\nThere’s no more transparent, honest, devout, and upright public servant than Chuck Grassley. Don’t let the penny-pinching Senator’s unfailing courtesy and approachability fool you - beneath that aw-shucks-slop-the-hogs manner is an accomplished, smart, seasoned, tough-as-nails legislator who hasn’t lost his mojo.\n\nHe was elected to his first public office—the Iowa legislature—when I was still in diapers. He’s been unfailingly loyal to his party and his president. Still, he’s first and foremost a loyal Senate institutionalist of 45 years, with a deep devotion to tradition, principle, and the Constitution he has sworn to uphold.\n\nLet me explain what the “[blue slip](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL32013.pdf)” process is. First, it’s not a Senate rule. It’s a Senate _courtesy_ - a “gentleman’s agreement,” as Donald Trump called it - that’s [been around since 1917](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL32013.pdf) and is designed to ensure consultation between the White House and Senators on nominees for district court judges and US attorneys (sometimes other positions, such as US Marshals) who require Senate confirmation through the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThere’s actually a blue form distributed to Senators by the Committee, giving them three options: to return a “positive” blue slip, a “negative” one, or not to return one at all. And how that process is managed is purely the prerogative of the Chairman.\n\nSenator Grassley is in his second stint as chair of the Judiciary Committee, having served in that role during Trump’s first term. GOP Senators, unlike Democratic Senators, are term-limited to six years either as chair or ranking member (Democrats don’t have term limits). Grassley bridged his service with six years as chair of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. Grassley is the only non-lawyer in recent history to serve as Judiciary Chair.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vv_F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5d587e-a18b-4acc-bc3c-d322b981c3a3_653x720.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vv_F!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5d587e-a18b-4acc-bc3c-d322b981c3a3_653x720.png)\n\nAll but two of the Judiciary Committee's 18 chairs since 1917, including Joe Biden during the 1990s, have not required “positive” blue slips to be returned for committee action. Others have, including Grassley’s immediate predecessor, former US Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT), although Leahy cautioned his colleagues not to abuse the process for partisan or ideological purposes.\n\nWhat’s triggering this controversy? Trump’s nomination of his former defense attorney, Alina Habba, to serve as US Attorney for New Jersey. The telegenic, tough-minded, and partisan lawyer is no favorite of the two Democratic Senators from the Garden State, Cory Booker and freshman Andy Kim, or the heavily Democratic legal establishment in their state. Both have refused to submit “positive” blue slips for Habba.\n\nBooker, the ambitious former Stanford football standout, [Rhodes Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker), and Newark mayor who struggled badly during his brief 2020 presidential run, is obviously gearing up for another run in 2028. Which means he has to oppose everything Trump does as he competes for the far-left progressive base of his increasingly insane party.\n\nGrassley has been clear and consistent on his policy concerning blue slips. “As I’ve said all along, I won’t allow the blue slip to be abused,” Grassley [told his colleagues](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-speaks-history-blue-slip-courtesy-judicial-nominees) in November 2017, during his first stint as Judiciary Committee chair. “I won’t allow senators to block nominees for political or ideological reasons. This position is consistent with the historical role of the blue slip courtesy. It also matches my personal experience with the blue slip.”\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCoik18x6Dc)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCoik18x6Dc) *[Grassley Speaks on the History of the Blue Slip Courtesy for Judicial Nominees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCoik18x6Dc)*\n\nSo, has he changed his policy by giving Senators Booker and Kim veto power over Habba’s nomination?\n\nNo. _Habba doesn’t have the votes yet to be favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate floor_. The MAGAverse is _wrongly focused_ on Grassley when they should be focused on his Judiciary Committee colleagues, especially one Thom Tillis (R-NC), who takes an extreme view of the blue-slip process. He apparently believes that Senators do have veto power, at least in this case. There may be one or two others. There’s only a one-seat margin on the committee between Democrats and Republicans, so it just takes one GOP vote, combined with Democrats in lockstep, to torpedo a nomination.\n\nI have little doubt that Grassley would report Habba’s nomination in a heartbeat if the votes were there to report it favorably to the full Senate. But being a smart chair, Grassley is protecting the President from embarrassment - and by extension, Habba, too - by using the blue-slip process to prevent defeat.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2nQj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17df9c00-b275-40e1-b730-669307971f7a_662x580.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2nQj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17df9c00-b275-40e1-b730-669307971f7a_662x580.png)\n\nTillis is not seeking reelection in 2026, so no amount of pressure will affect him, either. Habba’s reaction, instead of finding a way to assure Tillis and his GOP colleagues of her qualifications to be the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, went on Fox Business to criticize Grassley and Tillis.\n\nThat was stupid on steroids, if she’s serious about being confirmed. Maybe she’s just trying to burnish her MAGA credentials before the White House withdraws her nomination, _which is coming_.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the MAGAverse and, by extension, Donald Trump, for their failure to acknowledge all that Grassley and his brilliant Judiciary Committee staff have done to expose corruption of our federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Don’t believe me? Check these out.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P5vi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff6c2b9c-5a34-4d33-b449-ef7ebabe1d39_662x521.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!P5vi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff6c2b9c-5a34-4d33-b449-ef7ebabe1d39_662x521.jpeg)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3UPX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28b47d90-6ad1-4864-8166-266b4f000c34_667x603.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3UPX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28b47d90-6ad1-4864-8166-266b4f000c34_667x603.jpeg)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!K07k!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc98c4a4a-0333-4bd3-91ab-e8e85684d366_662x617.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!K07k!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc98c4a4a-0333-4bd3-91ab-e8e85684d366_662x617.jpeg)\n\nYou MAGAverse folks need to listen to MAGA lawyer Mike Davis on the blue-slip issue. He’s figured it out.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gf-_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F823983cd-28c5-4b0d-a5df-c94e954610a3_591x742.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gf-_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F823983cd-28c5-4b0d-a5df-c94e954610a3_591x742.jpeg)\n\nI’m a fan of the blue slip process under Grassley’s and most of his predecessors’ policies. It’s designed to give Senators a say on nominees for positions in their states. It doesn’t, and shouldn’t, provide them with veto power, and trust me, neither Cory Booker nor Andy Kim has any real influence here. After all, the performative “[Spartacus](https://youtu.be/yzD1OqIsCEM?si=wgeK-sX0DpvLuQgS)” Booker walked out of a committee hearing over Grassley’s refusal to honor the blue-slip process over the [confirmation of Emil Bove](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-booker-rails-against-senate-committee-vote-for-trump-lawyer-as-democrats-stage-walk-out) for a slot on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Blue slips have less influence over nominations to multi-state appeals courts.\n\nGrassley is helping Trump avoid embarrassment. And Trump’s claiming that he somehow is responsible for Grassley’s last reelection is not only wrong, [but a lie](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5427707-grassley-trump-insults-senate-blue-slip/). I don’t know Habba, and I don’t doubt her communication skills (her qualifications as a federal prosecutor are another matter), but she’s handling the nomination process all wrong.\n\nTrump and the MAGAverse ought to be thanking Grassley instead of trashing him.",
