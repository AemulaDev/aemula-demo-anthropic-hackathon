Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nLast Tuesday at 8:37 AM, I woke to the soft buzzing of my phone on my desk, a photo of my Mom’s contact popping up, looking slightly judgmental, as my plan to sleep until most people were already an hour into their jobs got cut short early. In defense of my Mom’s early morning wakeup call, she forgot to factor in the two-hour college transfer time warp, that unique phenomenon that hits the second you step onto a university campus or into a three-bedroom two-bath home near campus with thirteen students trying to sleep inside.\n\nMy 9 AM alarm is actually a regular 7 AM alarm once you subtract those two hours of dorm time from real-world time. Between the music blasting above me right now at 11:03 PM loud enough to make me question whether I’m in my dorm or a club, it’s clear I’m surrounded by late risers.\n\nMost entertaining is observing the not-quite-sober crowd stumble back in at 2:30. Although my nights are more fueled by hot tea and decaf coffee than anything else. (hi Mom!) Random 1 AM trips to the Halal Cart right off campus for lamb and chicken over rice in freezing sleet, and you’d think this place never sleeps. And you’d be exactly right.\n\nExam week makes it worse. Atkins library is open 24 hours, delivery robots clog the sidewalks worse than drivers merging onto I-85, and emergency flashers seem to never stop blinking outside the dorms as Uber Eats and DoorDash cars pile up.\n\nEven calm, innocent campus staples like Bible studies, worship nights, and college ministries start at 9 PM and end closer to 10:30 or 11. As a former morning person, it was a personal nightmare as I adjusted to campus life.\n\nTwo years ago, I was waking up at 6 AM to hear birds on a nice morning walk. Now the only chirping I hear is my phone at 9:30 when the market opens — I had to sneak at least one finance reference in here — Either way, I’ve stopped judging night owls now that my own habits have slid straight into late-night mode.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cyyv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed26ef59-9391-4b61-9750-2bbc0e1d6235_756x989.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cyyv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed26ef59-9391-4b61-9750-2bbc0e1d6235_756x989.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Getting a Gyro after a late-night study of Accounting}}\n\nMy Mom has probably grown grateful that my ‘good night’ text now arrives at 8:45, while I’m eating dinner, instead of 11:45, when I’m pouring my first cup of tea before diving into homework. After getting lambasted for that late text, I realized the truth: the actual time zone difference between the real world and the college world is two hours. Think about it. Going to bed at 1 AM on a weeknight sounds criminal to most, but in real-world time, that’s actually 11 PM. Perfectly normal. Perfectly respectable. Practically disciplined.\n\nAs a former morning person, I used to look down on those mythical night owls who stayed up until Taco Bell closed and tiptoed around at 2 AM like secret agents. Now I get it. There’s a strange beauty in the quiet of campus at night, lit only by a few stars and a thousand multicolored string lights peeking out of windows. It gives you a moment to reflect, to appreciate making it through your first semester, and to hope that next semester comes with less loud music and no more 4 AM fire alarms.\n\nTo parents of college students: please don’t destroy us as we roll out of bed at 11 AM during winter break, that’s pretty early for us. And when you hear the pitter-patter of footsteps in the kitchen at 11:30 PM, imagine the late dinner your kid is happily enjoying. Anyway, I’m off to get appetizers for dinner here at 11:15 and maybe grab a coffee too. The night is still young after all.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
