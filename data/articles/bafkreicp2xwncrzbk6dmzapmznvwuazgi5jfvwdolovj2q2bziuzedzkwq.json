Years ago, that hunt meant spending whole days in university libraries, newspapers, and book stores. Now the “library” never closes — it’s online, loud, and enormous. My writing is how I move through all of it. I check the facts, I boil it down, and sharing it helps me understand it. What you get is the distilled version — a story instead of static.\n\nLast year, I spent most of my time trying to understand what’s been happening to this country — not in theory, but in the way it lands in real lives. Some of it has been intentional policy; some of it has been rot and neglect. We’ve seen hospitals pulled into politics. Teachers pushed out. Research money tied to control. Voting rules rewritten. Energy decisions made for cable news clips and oligarch cronies instead of the future. I wasn’t trying to catalogue every problem; I was trying to understand the shape of the moment — and I took you with me. Again and again, the roots I found were the same: greed, racism, and a level of indifference toward regular people that should make everyone angry.\n\nThis year, the work shifts.\n\nI’ll still be watching what unfolds day to day — I can’t help myself — but I want to spend more time looking forward. If rebuilding becomes possible, where do we even begin? Voting access? Guardrails on presidential power? Science and public health? Trust between neighbors? And if rebuilding doesn’t come fast — if we end up living in this version of America longer than we hoped — how, and where, do regular people build lives that still feel decent, meaningful, even hopeful?\n\nIn 2026, my Daily Updates will be about those questions: places and people who’ve found solutions before we have, ideas that actually worked on the ground, communities that refused to give in, and practical tools — civic, informational, personal — that can leave us feeling a little less powerless and a little more prepared.\n\nAnd I want you in the room for that. Your questions, your emails, your arguments — they’ve steered my work more times than I can count. They will again. This only works if it feels like a conversation, not a broadcast.\n\nThank you for reading. Thank you for thinking. Thank you for making space for this in your day.\n\nHere’s to 2026. Whatever it turns out to be — we’ll find our way through it, together.",
