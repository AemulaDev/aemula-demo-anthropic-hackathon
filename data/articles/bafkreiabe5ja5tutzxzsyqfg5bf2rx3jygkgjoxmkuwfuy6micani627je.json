Learn about our approach to collective intelligence and managing the complexity of technological change* *[here](https://tamingcomplexity.substack.com/about).*\n\n***\n\nSimply put: If we want to find a winning formula for Democratic politicians, we shouldn’t look to a city has voted for the blue presidential candidate, often at 60-plus percentage levels, since 1928.\n\nMusa al-Gharbi [posted](https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/a-graveyard-of-bad-nyc-mayoral-election) a great overview of the all the bad election hot takes, finding that, as far as the numbers are concerned, Mamdani isn’t a whole lot different from previous mayors. The coalitions that put them into power looked about the same, and the differences between those who voted for Cuomo and those who cast a ballot for Mamdani aren’t all that significant.\n\nAs I [pointed out](https://tamingcomplexity.substack.com/p/the-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-democratic) after Mamdani’s primary victory, a great deal of the pundit class have a narrative to push and they very much want Mamdani’s electoral success to corroborate it. And there’s an infinite array of statistics that can massaged fit their preferred storyline.\n\nThe story that I see, partly thanks to al-Gharbi’s summation, is a small blip in an otherwise clear trend of political apathy and polarization. Like for a great deal of other elections, the non-official winner was “no one,” because most eligible New Yorkers could be bothered to go to the polls. And most of those who were newly galvanized show up to fill out a ballot card seemed to have been there primarily to try to prevent a Mamdani mayoralty.\n\nWhatever the history books will conclude about Mamdani’s tenure as mayor, it will have little to do with the slice of the population that put in into office and everything to do with what he actually accomplishes as the city’s executive. We’ll just have to wait and see.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-6P2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4ce6466-9af9-489d-9b13-77aee2a08c92_1152x1152.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-6P2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4ce6466-9af9-489d-9b13-77aee2a08c92_1152x1152.jpeg)\n\n***\n\n*This article reproduces content from Taming Complexity, a Substack from a group of political analysts exploring why organizations and societies make bad decisions about science and technology, and how they could make better ones.*\n\n*Taming Complexity is written by Taylor Dotson, Michael Bouchey, and Shunryu Garvey.
