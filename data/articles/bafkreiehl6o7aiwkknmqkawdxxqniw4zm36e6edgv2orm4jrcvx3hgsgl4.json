  "preview": "The Second Amendment is one of a few \"natural rights.\"",
  "body": "The Second Amendment is one of a few “natural rights.” They are those rights, including the right to free speech, the right to a free press, the right to freedom of religion, and the right to keep and bear arms, that pre-exist government. They are **unalienable** rights granted to us not by the government but by our Creator. The right to keep and bear arms did not originate with the Constitution; it originated from the necessity of and human right to liberty. It originated from the belief that the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness require the right to defend your life, liberty, and happiness with deadly force. The Founders further recognized that only an **individual** right to keep and bear arms, not a **collective** right, exercised only under conditions of having been called to conflict as a militia and having followed a formal process to become a citizen, preserves the security of a free state. \n\nWhen you advocate for removing an individual right from non-citizens and describe that right as a “benefit of citizenship” you are enabling government to decide who has natural rights instead of ensuring that government protects them for everyone, since citizenship is granted by government. Moreover, you are denying that belief which is most core to the philosophy of conservatism; the Second Amendment protects the First. It is the right that Alexander Hamilton defended in Federalist No. 29 to prevent armies from becoming tyrannical. It is a right that we have fought up to the Supreme Court for decades to keep without sparking a second Revolution. You are agreeing with Bob Ferguson that the 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms is subject to the whims of the government, not available to be taken up by a free people against a tyrannical one. There are two rights I would die to lose: My right to vote and my right to keep and bear arms. I use the second to protect the first and taking the latter leads to losing the former. \n\nYou’ve decided you so fear your neighbors and countrymen that it is better for the federal government than for the individual (or individuals in the case of a jury) to determine who should own a gun. You’ve declared yourself judge, jury, and executioner, determining without due process of law (another violation of a Constitutional right) when someone should or should not be free to defend themselves from violence. You’ve declared that non-citizens are less equal than Americans under the law (a 14th Amendment violation). The only thing strong enough to remove your right to keep and bear arms is a felony conviction– one that comes with a year of jail time– or a domestic violence conviction because you nearly violated another person's natural right– life– with violence.\n\nEven then, we do not remove the right to keep and bear arms from them forever. Every right restricted due to criminal conviction can be restored by a judge. Whether an undisputed civil domestic violence protection order is enough due process to warrant the restriction of a natural right is being challenged at the Supreme Court right now. Americans should not believe in handing exclusive power to the federal government to determine that natural rights only apply to certain classes of people. We don't want to become Animal Farm, where, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"",
