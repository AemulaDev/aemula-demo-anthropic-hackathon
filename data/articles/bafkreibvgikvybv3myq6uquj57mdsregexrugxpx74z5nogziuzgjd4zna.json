  "body": "Charlie Kirk is dead. He was shot in the neck from great distance yesterday during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah; he died shortly thereafter. He was killed in front of his wife, his three-year-old daughter and one-year-old son, and a crowd that had come to learn from and contend with him.\n\nIt is tempting, in the wake of a genuine shock to the nation's political consciousness-and I think this was that-to seek patterns, to take information available and unavailable and extrapolate until the shadows merge to form a clearer picture. That impulse is human: we want heroes and villains, scapegoats and victims; our conscious self flips and grabs and twists and smooths at the behest of unconscious urges to understand, to be good, to be *right*, to be safe. In a modern world where so many of us have social media accounts, there is both opportunity and often significant pressure to share our thoughts publicly. The Internet and our political discourse grow loud, loud, and louder-ironically, at a time when a voice which once was loud has, with the squeeze of a trigger, been quieted.\n\nForget, for a moment, the broader considerations. Forget what you think historians might say 100 years from now about Kirk's meteoric rise and outsized role in our politics. Forget whether you feel his murder fits neatly into a clear constellation of related events, or was effectively random. Forget whether his life is of any greater or lesser worth than those of the children slain in a Minneapolis church in late August, or the Ukrainian refugee stabbed to death on a train in Charlotte the week before, or the security officers and white collar workers killed in a New York City skyscraper in July, or any of the multitude of people, innocent and not, grown and not, who have lost their lives to violence or famine in Gaza, Israel, Ukraine, the Sudan, and elsewhere. Forget Kirk the public figure, whatever he might have been to you-a leader, a provocateur, a firebrand, a champion of civil debate, or something less savory.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCMr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8054295c-551c-4f53-86bc-42381453d357_2560x1706.jpeg)\n\nMy son is two years old. I can see him now, on the monitor, asleep crossways in the crib with his feet pushed through the bars on the side closest to the wall. He just turned his head, moaned, and resettled.\n\nWhen I get home from work, some nine or so hours after I saw him last, his face splits in a half-moon grin, too-sharp toddler teeth poking past his upper lip before he yells, \"Dada! Dada!\" Yesterday, he and my wife were waiting outside on the porch, living echoes of a time more than thirty years ago when I waited on a similar porch, on a similar summer night, for my dad to return from the same law firm I joined last week.\n\nI wish time would stop when he puts his head on my shoulder. Not because I don't want him to grow up, because I do-I want him to be three, and five, and thirteen, and forty-six, and ninety-two, and a hundred and eleventeen, and a million billion ages beyond that. I want to coach his Little League team, and teach him the piano, and follow him smiling as he chooses where to go. I wish time would stop, but go, and stop, but go because I want all of those ages, and all of those moments, to last forever. I don't ever want to stop being his dad.\n\nPerhaps the benefit of the death of a young public figure, to the extent we can be so crass as to call it that, is that it reminds us what death is, what death does; what violence is, what violence does. Death erases: it leaves holes, cuts timelines, snips memories held by two hands across two minds. Charlie Kirk's daughter will remember him, though only just; his son won't. They'll know him through videos, and stories from their mother, and more stories from the thousands of people who will meet Charlie Kirk's children and want to tell them about their father. They'll read plenty of good, and bad too.\n\nHis wife will sleep in a bed too cold on one side. There will be smells and sounds which blur past and present, present and future; moments where it didn't happen, and that's him pulling up outside, or at the other end of a buzzing phone, or on television not because someone is replaying a speech but because he's still there, speaking, living, breathing; then, silence.\n\nThe losses we mourn are the ones we see. Everything that is true of Kirk's family is true of the families you don't read about-the families of those not famous enough for the newspaper who are murdered, who die in accidents or of sudden disease-the families of those multitudes dying in foreign, more dangerous, less prosperous lands, those who to us are little more than statistics, if that. They will have the same cold beds and empty chairs at empty tables.\n\nThat is true, as it is with Kirk, even of those who, for political or other reasons, we might convince ourselves deserve it. We should resist the temptation to dehumanize. We should have the courage to call the dead-even the dead we think unforgivable; even the dead with whom we or groups we support are engaged in pitched political battle or actual, open warfare-what they are: fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and sons and daughters of someone who does not want them to die, who will miss them when they're gone. Violence is natural, but that does not make it right.\n\nThere is much more to write: whether we are seeing an actual uptick in political violence and why is worthy of serious discussion, as is Kirk's legacy, as are the implications of an assassin choosing Kirk, not any of a hundred other political figures.\n\nBut for today, it seems appropriate to treat this article as a life interrupted, and end\n\n*This article reproduces content from Never Close the Inquiry, written by Nick Hagen, and is available at [https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/](https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/).
