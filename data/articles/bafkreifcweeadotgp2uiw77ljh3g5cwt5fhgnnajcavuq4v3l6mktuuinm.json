But we have to pretend that we could._ A senior German official said that to Reuters after nearly twenty Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace and Poland—supported by other NATO aircraft—shot several down.¹\n\nThis wasn’t a seminar on burden-sharing. It was the alliance’s eastern edge watching a live-fire violation and then watching Washington hesitate. Trump’s initial reaction—“It could have been a mistake”—read in European capitals not as prudence but as a shrug.¹ And the shrugs matter, because NATO is not only a collection of forces; it is an insurance policy written in confidence. When the underwriter starts acting erratic, every client quietly recalculates their coverage.\n\nReliability isn’t a mood. In alliances, it’s a weapon system.\n\nWhat changed in 2025 wasn’t that allies discovered America is self-interested. They always knew that. Hedging has always existed in alliance politics. What changed is scale, speed, and formalization. What had once been quiet contingency planning became explicit, bureaucratized, and accelerated—no longer a background habit, but an operational assumption built directly into policy. U.S. unpredictability began showing up not as a philosophical concern, but as an immediate hazard—something planners had to route around the way you route around a bridge that might be closed tomorrow.\n\nYou can see the fracture line in how Europeans talked about the Poland incident. Reuters reported diplomats describing dismay, confusion, and “unease,” with one official calling Washington’s silence “almost deafening.”¹ The most revealing voice in that reporting wasn’t an opposition politician or a columnist. It came from inside the European establishment, quietly articulating the central paradox of the Trump era: behave as if the guarantee still holds, even while preparing for the possibility that it doesn’t.¹\n\nOn paper, NATO leadership tried to seal the crack. In a January 13, 2025 transcript, Secretary-General Mark Rutte insisted, “Europe can rely on the United States,” adding that he was “absolutely convinced” Washington would remain in NATO.² But notice the pivot in the same breath. Europe must “spend more ourselves,” because two percent is “not nearly enough,” followed by a line that landed like gallows humor—learn Russian, move to New Zealand, or spend more.² Public reassurance paired with urgent contingency planning is not reassurance. It is the alliance keeping its face composed while quietly packing a go-bag.\n\nWhen leaders swear the bridge is safe while buying ferries, everyone notices.\n\nTrump’s defenders often point to formal documents—strategy papers, speeches, communiqués—as evidence of continuity. The 2025 National Security Strategy, they argue, still affirms NATO, still endorses collective defense, still demands allied strength rather than withdrawal.³ That argument has surface appeal. Burden-sharing debates long predate Trump, and frustration with European defense spending is hardly new.\n\nBut the same document helps explain why allies began treating U.S. commitments as conditional. It frames alliances through fairness and free-riding, declaring Washington will “insist on being treated fairly” and expects allies to spend far more to correct “enormous imbalances.”³ That framing does not reject alliances—but it subtly reclassifies them. Security guarantees become adjustable instruments rather than foundational commitments. Something to be tightened, priced, or relaxed depending on political context.\n\nThat shift is what turns reliability into a national-security risk. A risk is not a certainty; it is a probability that must be priced. By 2025, allies had begun pricing it more aggressively than before.\n\nThis is where hedging becomes architecture.\n\nCanada offers the cleanest example—not because Ottawa suddenly stopped trusting Washington, but because it started building redundancy against volatility. Reuters described the June 2025 EU–Canada summit as “not business as usual,” explicitly framing the new security and defense partnership as a response to “increased geopolitical threats,” including a “more hostile U.S. president.”⁴ When a close ally signs a major defense pact with Europe and the wire story casually names the United States as part of the threat environment, the signal is structural, not rhetorical.\n\nThis wasn’t symbolism. A defense-industries study prepared for the European Union’s diplomatic service lists an “isolationist United States” among the forces pushing democracies toward deeper cooperation, warning that gaps in expectations and commitments risk weakening unity and triggering retaliatory policy measures.⁵ That is bureaucratic language doing what it always does: translating political uncertainty into procurement rules, consultation mechanisms, and supply-chain design. In other words, resilience.\n\nIn December 2025, the EU Council endorsed an agreement enabling Canada’s participation in SAFE, a €150-billion defense instrument, making Canada the first non-European country included.⁶ This hardens cooperation into financing and joint procurement logic that outlasts any one government. It is the opposite of a handshake deal. It is security architecture designed to function even if Washington becomes unreliable.\n\nWiden the lens to the Arctic, where Trump’s style of leverage produced a different kind of reliability shock. When a U.S. president talks about Greenland like a real-estate acquisition, it isn’t only Denmark that hears the threat. It forces allies to confront an uncomfortable question: if territorial integrity is rhetorically optional, what does collective defense actually guarantee? Reuters reported Trump naming Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland; Denmark and Greenland responded together: “You cannot annex another country.”⁷ Chatham House put the implication bluntly: threats against Greenland risk undermining Article 5, because alliance credibility depends not just on military capability but on respect for legal and political norms.⁸\n\nIf an ally can’t trust you not to seize allied territory, collective defense becomes a slogan.\n\nReliability isn’t only tanks and treaties. It is the daily machinery that makes alliances function: supply chains, industrial capacity, and the assumption that rules won’t change mid-shipment. In 2025, fast-changing tariffs didn’t just raise prices. They injected uncertainty into production schedules, investment decisions, and workforce stability—the very systems that sustain readiness over time.\n\nIn Warren, Michigan, Stellantis announced temporary layoffs and production pauses. Reuters quoted UAW Local 869 president Romaine McKinney III: \\*It’s pure devastation.\\*⁹ Across the river in Windsor, Unifor warned thousands of workers faced layoffs and shutdowns. President Lana Payne said the pain would arrive “almost immediately,” adding that Trump was “about to learn how interconnected the North American production system is the hard way.”¹⁰\n\nThose aren’t abstract ripples. They are capacity signals. When firms cannot predict trade rules, they defer investment, shorten planning horizons, and reduce slack. Over time, that degrades the industrial base allies rely on in crises—not because factories vanish overnight, but because resilience quietly thins.\n\nProPublica captured the same dynamic through a quieter collapse: a 99-year-old Michigan manufacturer, Howard Miller, closing after tariffs “rattled the supply chain.” The company’s CEO said hopes for recovery were “quickly dashed.”¹¹ Furniture and clocks, not missiles—but the same mechanism. Policy volatility compresses time. And compressed time undermines preparedness.\n\nUnreliability is contagious. It spreads from rhetoric to contracts to war plans.\n\nThe story here is not a single dramatic rupture. It is a pattern. Allies watch Washington go equivocal where clarity once came automatically. Strategy documents recast guarantees as adjustable transactions. And allies respond by building parallel architectures—European procurement frameworks, Canadian participation in SAFE, diversified supply pathways—because the United States has become a source of uncertainty rather than stability.\n\nThat is the flip. The U.S. is no longer only the protector allies sometimes resent. Under Trump, it becomes a variable they must hedge—quietly, methodically, with spreadsheets and clauses that assume tomorrow may not resemble yesterday.\n\nOnce allies start writing policy as if the guarantee might fail, the guarantee has already changed. Deterrence rests on shared belief in predictable response. When that belief weakens, the crack you heard at the start isn’t cosmetic.\n\nIt’s structural.\n\nAnd the sound is not unfamiliar.\n\n_(A longer view of how American power learned to sound this way follows on Saturday.)_\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
