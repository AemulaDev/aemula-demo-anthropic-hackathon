Now that I am in college, I see those questions playing out in real time. Some classmates know precisely where they are headed, but many are still figuring it out, often while facing additional financial and personal challenges. The reflections I wrote then feel just as relevant now, as the choices only get harder once you are on campus._\n\nSince I was 13 years old, I've generally known what I'd like to do for a career. Since last year, I've known what college I want to attend and what I'd like to do after graduation. I've gradually learned that most people still need to determine what they'd like to do after college, even while applying for college and occasionally working toward a degree. My desired career, financial planning, requires a degree, and going to college will be a good decision for me in the long run. However, deciding to go to college and pursue a degree is more nuanced for someone who might not yet know what they'd like to do.\n\nShelling out tens of thousands of dollars, if not six figures, on a degree you might not use is risky, and a lack of a plan after college is scary. Thankfully, more employers are open to hiring candidates who have not followed a typical post-high school path. The changing dynamics of the job market also play a crucial role in shaping decisions about higher education and career paths. New professions in industries that didn't exist a decade ago are materializing, further complicating the decision-making process for a typical 30-year career. Moreover, soft skills, including adaptability, communication, and critical thinking, are increasingly recognized across industries as essential. This shift suggests that the value of a college degree is the accreditation, not solely in the specific field of study.\n\nIndividuals must consider the correlation between education and job prospects and the indirect benefits of personal growth and adaptability while navigating their future. Depending on the situation and desired career, going to college could be a detriment since it would likely leave you in substantial debt. Everyone must decide their best path, whether a four-year degree, a trade school, or even joining the armed forces.\n\n_Yikes, it sounds a little boisterous to say I have known what I want to do since I was 13. Most people do not, and even now in college, I see how difficult that uncertainty can be. College can be a launchpad, but it can also be an expensive detour without a clear path. The real challenge is not just picking a school; it is deciding whether you are ready to invest in yourself._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
