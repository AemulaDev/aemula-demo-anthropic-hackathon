  "body": "_I originally wrote this piece for_ _[my print magazine](https://thenewmodality.com/)_ _in 2020. The version below has been slightly edited to be up-to-date, and it includes a few additional details._\n\n—\n\nOver in Santa Fe, the “[House of Eternal Return](https://meowwolf.com/visit/santa-fe/about)” — a kind of psychedelic Disneyland, created by the art collective Meow Wolf — has become famous among weirdos. Indie travel site _Atlas Obscura_ [says](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/house-of-eternal-return) it’s “an immersive environment that is part haunted house, part choose-your-own-adventure, and part jungle gym.”\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AHAP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a75e35f-378c-45e3-ad1f-c28f80559417_2100x2100.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AHAP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a75e35f-378c-45e3-ad1f-c28f80559417_2100x2100.png)\n\n{{caption:This photo of the House of Eternal Return’s upstairs toilet was donated to my magazine by photographer Jane Hu, who does a lot of neat counterculture photography.

Here’s an excerpt:\n\n> **Liability Waiver Form Required for Entrance to Portals Bermuda:\n> The Multiverse’s Premiere Resort for the Spiritually Aware**\n>\n> The risk of injury or death at Portals Bermuda is significant, including but not limited to:\n>\n> * **Permanent** spatial/temporal displacement due to wormhole malfunctions\n>\n> * **Disappearance** by an interdimensional police organization (a.k.a. “The Charter”), the agents of which may or may not have infiltrated Portals Bermuda\n>\n> * **Centipede** attacks in the swamps of the Carboniferous Forest\n>\n> * \\[[etc](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHyFNr6DrSM/).]\n\nThe House of Eternal Return is reportedly the most Instagrammed place in New Mexico, [surpassing even](https://www.krqe.com/news/news-briefs/meow-wolf-surpasses-balloon-fiesta-as-most-instagrammed-place-in-new-mexico/1009375112) the yearly Balloon Festival, and I am probably the only person left in the journalism industry willing to make on-the-record statements like “I love Instagram.”\n\nMuch of the serious art world curls its lip at “Instagram museums.” To be fair, many non-Meow Wolf examples are rather shallow. In a 2018 _New York Times_ article titled “[The Existential Void of the Pop-Up ‘Experience,’](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/arts/color-factory-museum-of-ice-cream-rose-mansion-29rooms-candytopia.html)” the always-entertaining Amanda Hess reports on New York City spaces like the Rosé Mansion, Color Factory, Candytopia, and the Museum of Ice Cream: “I went to as many Instagrammable ‘museums,’ ‘factories,’ and ‘mansions’ as I could,” she writes. “They nearly broke me… It was as if I was witnessing the total erosion of meaning itself.”\n\nHess is a pop culture critic, and her article is gentle compared to those by fine art critics. Attacking the Museum of Ice Cream [in the online journal](https://news.artnet.com/opinion/gray-market-museum-ice-cream-1634467) _[artnet](https://news.artnet.com/opinion/gray-market-museum-ice-cream-1634467)_ _(artnet’s_ name is lowercase on purpose), Tim Schneider uses words like “decry,” “disgust,” and “outrageous,” and notes that “I might rather live under a bridge for the rest of this year than experience \\[the MOIC] in person.”\n\nThe source of his rage becomes clear as Schneider explores the MOIC’s business model: It’s “depressingly sustainable compared to legitimate art museums and galleries,” he says.\n\n[Read more](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/whats-the-return-on-meow-wolfs-house)\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
