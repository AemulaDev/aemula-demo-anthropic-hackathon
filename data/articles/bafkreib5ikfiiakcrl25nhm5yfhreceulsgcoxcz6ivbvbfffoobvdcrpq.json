  "preview": "There are statewide elections on November 4th in states I know pretty well. Will the results have any implications nationally for 2026? History favors the Democrats, but. . .",
  "body": "People often associate elections with even-numbered years; however, for several states, elections are held every year. Pennsylvania is conducting elections for local, school board, and county offices, as well as “[retention” elections for three](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/02/judicial-retention-election-pennsylvania-2025-supreme-court-partisan/) Democratic State Supreme Court Justices. The Keystone State is one of the few that elects partisan court justices and judges, and Democrats hold a 5-2 edge. They’ve made their share of controversial decisions over voting and counting votes, sometimes in apparent violation of the state’s constitution. [Courts have ruled otherwise](https://statecourtreport.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/pennsylvania-supreme-court-says-provisional-ballots-cast-voters-whose).\n\nBut most eyes are on races in the Commonwealth of Virginia, where I live, and the State of New Jersey, where I worked for nearly two decades until 2018. These two states couldn’t be more different historically, culturally, and politically. Yet, their results in the 2024 presidential election nearly mirrored each other, with Trump losing to Kamala Harris by surprisingly narrow mid-single-digit margins. Just four years earlier, Joe Biden triumphed by double-digit margins, and Hillary Clinton almost did as well in 2016.\n\n**History Favors the Democrats**\n\nBoth states have a history of electing governors and other officials from the opposing party that holds the White House. There have been rare exceptions, including in 2013 when New York native and Bill and Hillary Clinton fixer and fundraiser Terry McAuliffe (D) narrowly won the governor’s race over Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, mainly on the strength of McAuliffe’s base in fast-growing and intensely blue northern Virginia and its progressive and largely real-estate, high-tech, and “beltway bandit” (government-funded contractor) business community.\n\nNorthern Virginia’s five counties are among the [wealthiest in America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-income_counties_in_the_United_States), particularly Loudoun, Fairfax, and Arlington. _Americans have taken notice_.\n\nFollowing Trump’s upset election in 2016, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam defeated my friend and former Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie in 2017, again keeping Democrats firmly ensconced in all three top statewide positions and complete control of the legislature. In Virginia, governors can’t run for reelection; lieutenant governors and attorneys general can. Northam was undoubtedly helped by outgoing Gov. McAuliffe's restoration of [voting rights to over 200,000 ex-convicts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36116170) before the 2016 (to help his friend Hillary) and 2017 elections.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x4E!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0097e7d3-f9bc-4d4d-ad05-f49073eb4b6e_600x656.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x4E!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0097e7d3-f9bc-4d4d-ad05-f49073eb4b6e_600x656.jpeg)\n\nNew Jersey reacted similarly in 2009, following Barack Obama’s election, by sending former GOP US Attorney Chris Christie to the Governor’s mansion by defeating incumbent former US Senator and Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine, with help from independent candidate Chris Daggett, who drew slightly more votes than the margin of Christie’s win. With Obama still in the White House (and their famous “bromance” following the Superstorm Sandy hurricane disaster of 2012), Christie trounced his Democratic opponent, State Sen. Barbara Buono, a year later.\n\nFollowing Trump’s election in 2016, New Jersey sent Democrat Phil Murphy to Trenton in 2017, defeating GOP Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who was no doubt hamstrung by Christie’s plummeting job approval ratings after his “[Bridgegate](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/supreme-court-reverses-fraud-convictions-of-christie-aides-in-nj-bridgegate-scandal.html)” scandal-tainted second term and ludicrous attempt to [abrogate an income tax reciprocity agreement with neighboring Pennsylvania](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/state-lobbying-part-iv-of-a-series?utm_source=publication-search). In the Garden State, until recently, the governor was the only elected statewide position, and he/she gets to name their running mate (New Jersey didn’t have lieutenant governors until a Constitutional amendment was passed in 2005 creating the position). Aside from Louisiana, New Jersey’s governor is among the nation’s most potent.\n\nMurphy somewhat defied the trend in 2021, but saw the margin of victory from his first election shrink as he won reelection over then-Assemblyman Jack Ciatarelli, who came within about 85,000 votes of an upset, out of over 2.6 million cast. “Jack4NJ” is back with a new running mate and is running a top-flight campaign in a state that is now, every so gradually, trending in his direction.\n\n[![New Jersey voter registration numbers show an alarming trend for Democrats ahead of the 2025 gubernatorial election (Canva)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M9ue!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f6c3e30-7845-4201-8388-3764e10f7930_1600x1067.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M9ue!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f6c3e30-7845-4201-8388-3764e10f7930_1600x1067.webp)\n\n*Source: NJ101.5 FM Radio*\n\nThe political environments and issues have very little in common between the two states, except that the Democratic tickets in both states are scandal-tainted and the polls have tightened. Virginia has a very popular outgoing GOP governor in Glenn Youngkin; New Jersey’s Phil Murphy, also term-limited, not so much, as his dream of bringing the “Massachusetts Miracle” (high taxes and lots of well-delivered services that attract high-tech businesses and well-paying jobs) hasn’t panned out - other than the higher taxes and utility bills. Murphy’s wife and highly ambitious First Lady of New Jersey, Tammy Murphy, dropped out of her race for US Senate in 2024 when she lagged badly in the polls to then-US Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ) following former US Senator Bob “[Gold Bars](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqe6m14drgjo)” Menendez’s conviction.\n\nNew Jerseyans have a high tolerance for political corruption, but they seem very frustrated over the unaffordability that is gripping their state.\n\nIn New Jersey, the issues are twofold: sky-high property taxes are driving people out of the state (New Jersey is one of the [leading states in net outmigration](https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/net-domestic-migration-which-states-are-gaining-and-losing-americans), along with California, New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois), and, in recent months, skyrocketing electricity rates (_upwards of 20 percent this year_) have also been a concern. Add to that US Rep. and Democratic nominee Mikie [Sherrill’s Naval Academy cheating scandal](https://johnalucas6.substack.com/p/what-is-the-true-story-behind-why) (she was denied the ability to “walk” at graduation and kept out of the official program). She claims it was punishment for her failing to “bilge” fellow cadets in a major academic cheating scandal, and two new polls have this race [dead even](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-jersey-2025-poll/). Voters over the age of 50, who have historically turned out in higher numbers than younger voters, are overwhelmingly supporting the GOP ticket.\n\nSherrill’s response to the Naval Academy cheating/graduation story is to blame the Trump Administration (_I could stop there_) for illegally leaking harmful parts of her record. Yet she refuses to release her files voluntarily, which might clear the air. The [Naval Academy Honor Co](https://go.navyonline.com/blog/what-is-the-usna-honor-concept)ncept basically requires cadets to pledge never to lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Sherrill admits she tolerated but didn’t report cheaters at the Academy, which is probably a precursor to success in New Jersey Democratic politics. But [there’s no evidence that the Academy punishes or has ever punished anyone for failing to rat on a cheating cadet](https://johnalucas6.substack.com/p/what-is-the-true-story-behind-why). Sherrill appears to be hiding something, possibly including [lying to naval investigators](https://nypost.com/2025/09/26/us-news/mikie-sherrills-husband-also-ensnared-in-massive-naval-academy-cheating-scandal/#:~:text=NJ%20Dem%20governor%20hopeful%20Mikie,Facebook/Mikie%20Sherrill).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ixd0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137b6137-b372-4978-9faf-9d7835a37328_735x733.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ixd0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137b6137-b372-4978-9faf-9d7835a37328_735x733.png)\n\nVoter registration changes and [early mail voting patterns](https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/voter-turnout-in-n-j-over-15-as-early-voting-explodes/) also suggest momentum in favor of Ciatarelli, who proposes pulling the Garden State out of a Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and reforming the state’s Board of Public Utilities to help lower utility rates.\n\n**New Jersey is in play. . . but so is Virginia**\n\nI predicted months ago that New Jersey was more likely to elect a Republican governor in 2025 than Virginia. It still looks that way today, but the campaigns of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears and her running mates, conservative radio talker and Lieutenant Governor nominee John Reid, and incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, are showing plenty of life, despite Sears and Reid being badly outspent by 3:1 margins or more. Miyares, in particular, seems well poised for victory and a chance to lead his party in the next gubernatorial contest (2029). He has outraised Democratic nominee Jay Jones.\n\nVirginia’s GOP ticket got off to an inauspicious start, and there’s little question that Sears isn’t the political talent (or wealthy campaign underwriter) that the former Carlyle Group CEO Youngkin proved to be four years ago (then again, Youngkin is a _remarkable_ political talent who clearly qualifies as presidential timber). The former U.S. Marine and Jamaican immigrant Sears jumped out in front of Miyares to launch her gubernatorial campaign in late 2024. Still, Sears stumbled from the beginning with a weak, inexperienced, and ineffective campaign manager, essentially wasting the summer. Sears has struggled with fundraising and consistency, and is criticized in some circles for her questionable campaign schedule, limited appearances, and limited media interviews.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0S5L!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F741f8556-68a6-4bc0-aa8c-d621abe7d6d2_1536x1024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0S5L!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F741f8556-68a6-4bc0-aa8c-d621abe7d6d2_1536x1024.jpeg)\n\n*Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears. Photo by the Virginia Mercury.*\n\n“Throughout the campaign, Earle-Sears has avoided many interactions that might lead to her being seriously questioned, be it by a business group or the news media,” writes veteran reporter and editor Dwanye Yancey with southwest Virginia’s _[Cardinal News](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/09/29/earle-sears-skips-many-of-the-things-candidates-for-governor-normally-do/)_. “Earle-Sears has rarely done interviews outside what seem to be ‘safe’ news outlets.” He later noted [the lack of issues and policy](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/10/07/spanberger-answers-questions-about-policy-earle-sears-does-not/) specifics on both the stump and her campaign website, especially compared to her loquacious running mates, Reid and Miyares, or even her Democratic opponent, former CIA case officer and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger.\n\nRecently, outgoing Gov. Youngkin has clearly interjected himself in the campaign with attacks on Spanberger and Jones, while rallying Republican faithful ([he spoke at my church with Sears on Sunday](https://youtu.be/EDbta9UZA00?si=ODJMErXlaWP3rZ5x)) and continuing to tout the success of his Administration. There’s no doubt that a Gov. Spanberger would scuttle most of Youngkin’s considerable legacy, which includes standing athwart a very left-wing Democratic legislature yelling stop, including a system for retail cannabis stores on nearly every street corner. Been to Denver lately, where recreational cannabis was legalized 12 years ago? You may think that’s a good thing, [but studies suggest otherwise](https://www.rmhidta.org/_files/ugd/4a67c3_b391ac360f974a8bbf868d2e3e25df3d.pdf).\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbta9UZA00)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbta9UZA00) *[Faith, Freedom, and the Future of Virginia | Glenn Youngkin & Winsome Sears at Cornerstone Chapel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbta9UZA00)*\n\nThe GOP ticket’s launch was also inauspicious for another reason. After popular Fairfax County (the state’s largest, and very blue) GOP Supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out of the nomination fight for lieutenant governor, radio talker and media consultant John Reid, who is openly gay, was left with the nomination. It not only left the GOP ticket without a candidate from vote-rich northern Virginia, which accounts for almost a third of the statewide vote and now represents the Democratic base vote, but a scandal also erupted over gay porn attached to an online Tumblr account allegedly owned by Reid.\n\nGov. Youngkin quickly called on Reid to withdraw from the race, but Reid [strongly denied that the account was his](https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/29/john-reid-imbroglio-tests-gender-sexuality-and-privacy-standards-in-virginia-politics/). [No proof](https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/john-reid-lieutenant-governor-virginia/291-a036e212-5c4a-45e6-a92a-a657386b2795) emerged to the contrary, GOP staffers involved in leaking the account resigned, and the scandal began to fade. Slowly but surely, as the strongly conservative Reid defiantly campaigned on, the party has cautiously coalesced around him, including the deeply evangelical Sears and Youngkin. Reid may be running the most innovative and aggressive retail campaign in Virginia, despite being significantly underfunded (he has only raised approximately $815,000 as of this writing). Thanks to the Attorney General’s contest and death threats against other Virginia Republican officials, he has begun to wear a bulletproof vest.\n\n[![May be an image of 1 person, suit and hat shop](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FrgY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd285b468-d6f6-4643-90b2-f94e58a28328_526x701.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FrgY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd285b468-d6f6-4643-90b2-f94e58a28328_526x701.jpeg)\n\n*Lt. Gov. candidate John Reid is in his closet, with a bulletproof vest. Photo from his campaign Facebook account. He has lots of hats.*\n\nSears rarely strays outside of cultural issues, with an occasional and welcome reference to the one issue that helped elect Jim Gilmore as governor in 1997: eliminating Virginia’s onerous and hated car tax, a very steep personal property tax on personal vehicles. But there is no follow-up, no plan, and no consistent drumming of the idea. Gilmore was succeeded not long after George W. Bush was elected by Richmond Democratic Mayor Tim Kaine, who promptly put a bullet into Gilmore’s popular car tax phase-out, which was underway. Thanks to now-US Senator Kaine and Democrats in the General Assembly, we continue to suffer from the car tax. Youngkin’s efforts to reduce or phase it out have been rebuffed, and in fairness, [a potential $3 billion hole in county coffers](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/07/21/earle-sears-and-spanberger-both-say-they-want-to-eliminate-the-car-tax-heres-why-that-is-unlikely-to-happen/) would need to be addressed.\n\nSpeaking of bullets, Virginia’s election is now dominated by Jay Jones, the 36-year-old African American former State Delegate from Norfolk - the Democratic nominee for _Attorney General_ - who was exposed recently for musing about putting two bullets into the head of former GOP House Speaker Todd Gilbert, over those of Pol Pot, the infamous Cambodian mass killer, and Adolf Hitler. He also fantasizes about Gilbert’s two children dying in his wife’s arms. All this was texted to a _Republican state delegate_, Carrie Coyner. It’s the kind of dirt that candidates know others have on them, and good candidate vetting discovers and exposes. Honest and competent candidates admit, own up, and plan to deal with it. _Oops_.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ZoJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6bbbc66-57cd-4f60-910d-83597b2d81af_742x548.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4ZoJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6bbbc66-57cd-4f60-910d-83597b2d81af_742x548.png)\n\n[As previously reported,](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/the-jones-scandal-and-problems-with) he also received _very favorable treatment_ for being caught speeding at 116 miles per hour (reckless driving, subject to imprisonment) on I-64 east of Richmond and violating even those terms, including illegally performing “community service” through his political action committee. He also said [dead cops would result in cops killing fewer people](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jay-jones-said-more-police-were-killed-would-reduce-shootings-civilians-according-virginia-lawmaker). Virginia police organizations are outraged.\n\nMiyares now leads the polls after once trailing by six points or more, and I suspect that margin will grow, despite 360,000 people having voted early without knowledge of the scandal, which emerged around October 3rd via _[National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/dem-ag-nominee-jay-jones-fantasized-about-shooting-former-virginia-gop-speaker-he-receives-both-bullets/)_ magazine. Not the _Washington Post_, not the _Richmond Times-Dispatch, and indeed not the Associated Press,_ but a conservative opinion magazine with, perhaps, a couple of thousand Virginia subscribers (including me).\n\nI guess 2022 was a challenging year for Jones, when he sent his texts and put the pedal to the metal shortly after midnight one night on a long stretch of mostly rural interstate highway. He resigned as a state delegate after losing a primary for state Attorney General the previous year, to incumbent Mark Herring. Herring then lost to Miyares in the general election. Reckless driving, fantasizing about dead cops, and killing Republican officials and their children isn’t a good look, and again, that was _all just three years ago_.\n\nJay Jones belongs in a psychiatrist’s office, not in a public office. Yet, he remains on the ballot, with advertising and an active X account working hard.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KNCl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F697ba50f-4608-4a3c-9c73-843a602fc8c6_738x558.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KNCl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F697ba50f-4608-4a3c-9c73-843a602fc8c6_738x558.png)\n\n*I’m still trying to figure out how one can “strengthen our democracy” by shooting two bullets into the heads of a political opponent.*\n\nSears tried to make this Issue One (along with biological boys in girls’ restrooms, but more about that in a moment) in their only debate. Still, Spanberger has refused to do more than renounce Jones’ view and claim that he has his own campaign to run (which, as Spanberger responded, Sears once said about Reid). Kaine said the Jones apology was enough, and _no Virginia Democrats have called on him to step down_. Many were quick to call on then-Gov. Ralph Northam, 6 years ago, when he was caught in a “black face” scandal involving his medical school yearbook, including Virginia’s Senior US Senator, Mark Warner, who is remarkably silent about Jay Jones and his violent musings. Consistency and integrity are not strong suits of the Senator.\n\n_Virginia Democrats: Black face, bad! Shooting Republicans and killing their kids, meh._\n\nSears constantly interrupted and disrupted the debate, but Spanberger stood stone-faced and unresponsive to Sears's questions about Jones’ unhinged and disqualifying remarks. It wasn’t a good look, and now it’s a Sears campaign commercial. I can’t post it here because _she hasn’t put any of her ads on her campaign website and doesn’t appear to have a YouTube account (!!)_.\n\nShe’s not exactly running a model campaign, to put it mildly, but might still pull it off. Stranger things have happened, even in politics.\n\nIt was just four years ago, with Youngkin trailing Democratic nominee McAuliffe on his attempted return to the governor’s mansion, that Loudoun County Public Schools in northern Virginia handed the challenger an issue - a male student transitioning to female who sexually assaulted a girl in a public school bathroom. The student was quietly transferred to another school, where he repeated the incident, as the school administrators attempted to cover it up. Parents in neighboring Fairfax County schools were outraged to find sexually explicit materials in public school libraries.\n\nWhen this came up in one of their 2021 debates, the former Governor uttered the famous line that handed the education issue to Youngkin and may have cost McAuliffe the election: [“I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”](https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/user-clip-terry-mcauliffe-i-dont-think-parents-should-be-telling-schools-what-they-should-teach/4979586) Parents felt otherwise and voted accordingly.\n\nLike clockwork, Loudoun County Public Schools and their [Policy 8040](https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-title-iv-investigation-bathroom-gender-female-male-public-schools-governor-glenn-youngkin-locker-room-video-policy-8040-virginia) are back. Earlier this year, three boys became uncomfortable when a biological female who was apparently transitioning began to undress in their school locker room. They reported it. And they, _not the offending biological female who filmed the exchange_, were suspended (disclosure: the boys and their families attend my church, Cornerstone Chapel in Leesburg, VA). Not only that, Loudoun County Public Schools accused the boys of sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination. A Virginia court has [halted the schools' suspension of students](https://wjla.com/news/local/judge-temporarily-blocks-lcps-from-suspending-boys-uncomfortable-with-girl-in-locker-room-school-board-stone-bridge-high-school-title-ix), and a US Department of Education investigation found that Loudoun County Schools violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.\n\nMeanwhile, as _[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/19/northern-virginia-schools-funding-transgender-bathroom-policies-00514961)_ has reported:\n\n> Five northern Virginia school districts are at risk of losing their federal funding after they rejected the terms of an agreement with the Education Department to resolve probes into their transgender students policies.\n>\n> Districts representing Alexandria City, Arlington County, Fairfax County, Loudoun County and Prince William County have been placed on high-risk status, the agency said Tuesday. The Education Department will now only reimburse these school districts, forcing the schools to pay their education expenses up front.\n>\n> More than $50 million of formula funding, discretionary grants and impact aid grants will be affected by the high-risk and reimbursement payment status. The agency says the effort is being conducted under an authority Education Secretary Linda McMahon has through the grant process. Department officials are also looking to suspend or terminate federal funding to these school districts for their civil rights violations.\n\nLoudoun’s equally progressive and woke Board of Supervisors is considering [a proposal](https://www.loudounnow.com/news/county-supervisors-may-cover-lcps-federal-funding-losses/article_65bb711e-e871-45cb-b755-029583f01430.html) to use our tax dollars to replace any lost federal funding. Loudoun has been the nation’s wealthiest county for several years in a row, and it is also among its most highly educated. _In a manner of speaking, I suppose. Wealth and education don’t make you wise or intelligent._\n\nIs this an issue where I live? _You betcha_. But how much do Virginia voters _really know?_ I’m not sure since most of the legacy media is ignoring the election and these issues. And it may be contributing somewhat to a burst of enthusiasm for early voting in mostly Republican areas of the state, much more so than the close-in, federal-employee-rich suburbs of Washington, DC. Early voting here began on September 19. Early voting is double what it was at this time four years ago.\n\n[![May be an image of map and text that says 'Last Updated 2025-10- 2025-10-1309:52 13 09:52:09 M BALLOTSCASI 1,534 + Morgantown\\* 12,345 Cumberland\\* E3 MARYLAND Winche BALTIMORE- AI CHARLESTON- WEST VIRGINIA Alexandria Beckley DELAWARE DIDLT- © OpenStreetMap |Map tiles by Carto'](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8GaO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cc066e-629a-46cc-b31b-6f309a352487_1032x687.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8GaO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cc066e-629a-46cc-b31b-6f309a352487_1032x687.jpeg)\n\n*The darker the shade of green, the higher the proportion of early voting.*\n\nWhile the history and the campaign cash (in Virginia) favor Democratic wins, the local issues, early voting trends, and closing messages clearly appear to favor the Republicans. New Jersey state elections feature public funding with spending limits, so there’s no overt spending advantage (independent spending is a different matter). Polling shows very close elections in both states. _It will all boil down to turnout_.\n\nThe [Charlie Kirk effect](https://www.captaink.us/p/kirks-martyrdom-created-a-political?r=2yvflv\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=false) is also not being discussed, but can’t be dismissed, especially in light of the Jay Jones controversy in Virginia. The same is true in New Jersey with the Zohran Mamdami effect, but his election is being held on the same day, and the state is already benefiting from an exodus of New Yorkers (Florida and other southern states more so).\n\nGiven the government shutdown (especially in Virginia), Trump’s unpopularity and lack of electoral success in both states in his past three elections (he’s never come close to carrying Virginia or New Jersey), it’s a wonder the elections this year are close at all.\n\nBut they are, and Republicans _could_ make history. And in Virginia, what a trifecta _quadfecta_ it would be: the _first woman of color_ to be a _Republican_, the nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln, a _first-generation immigrant and naturalized citizen_, in the cradle and _former capital of the Confederacy_. Wow. Add an openly gay conservative lieutenant governor and Cuban-American refugee, and more wows. _My head is spinning_.\n\nBut is anyone talking about this? _Nope_. Indeed, not the _Washington Post_, which _loves_ gay _Democratic_ candidates and many immigrants; [illegal ones, at least](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/06/06/kilmar-abrego-garcia-trump-deportation-effort/). Sears is an evangelical Christian, a Republican, and a conservative, which in many circles around here near your nation’s capital is repugnant if not _disqualifying_. After all, she’s off the ~~plantation~~ reservation.\n\nThe government shutdown doesn’t appear to be having any measurable impact on either race at this point. As for trends that might impact the 2026 congressional midterms, they’re unlikely to emerge in states where mostly local issues predominate, _but stay tuned_. Voter interest, intensity, and turnout, matched against demographics, will be closely monitored and studied. And as always, candidate and campaign quality _matter_.",
