Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nI clearly have a bias toward the word core. Core Curriculum. Core Portfolio. At this point, I am one ab workout away from rebranding the entire newsletter into a fitness blog. I may overuse the word, but the overlap is a feature — not a bug. Investing works best when the fundamentals are boring, repeatable, and stuck on autopilot.\n\nLast week, in “When You Invest Matters More Than You Think”, we discussed how investing all at once provides superior long-term returns rather than attempting to time the market throughout the year. This week, we move to the foundation of a long-term investment strategy: The Core Portfolio.\n\nOn October 5, 2025, _[“From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million”](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share\\&utm_medium=web)_ was published as the first entry in The Core Curriculum series. It focused on investing $25 a week into the S\\&P 500 over the long run as a simple path toward wealth and retirement. Once you have a solid underlying position in the good old S\\&P 500, it becomes time to diversify into higher-risk, higher-return investments.\n\nNo, not buying a stake in your favorite sports team, like the Steelers, or going all-in on NFTs. Remember those? Instead, this means tilting part of your portfolio toward the higher-growth segment of the U.S. stock market, commonly referred to as growth.\n\nQuick note for the non-finance major crowd: an index is simply a collection of stocks grouped together to represent a part of the market, such as large companies, growth stocks, or the overall economy.\n\nThe NASDAQ 100 is the typical reference point for growth investing, but it has one key weakness. What some view as a feature becomes a limitation over the long term. The index is heavily concentrated in technology while excluding financial companies entirely. That means businesses like Visa and Mastercard, which have outperformed the S\\&P 500 over long stretches, are missing despite being excellent examples of high-growth companies that are not traditional tech firms.\n\nMy preferred growth vehicle is the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF, ticker SCHG. With an expense ratio of just 0.04%, it is extraordinarily cheap. It tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Index, which we will shorten to the very unofficial Dow Jones Growth Index.\n\nThe Dow Jones Growth Index holds just over 200 companies and follows a strict rules-based methodology. It draws only from the top 750 publicly traded U.S. stocks. It uses a six-factor framework to classify companies as growth or value.\n\nMetrics include revenue expansion, earnings growth, momentum, price-to-book ratios, dividend yield, and long-term earnings-per-share growth. These factors are combined into a proprietary composite score that determines a company’s classification.\n\nWhile the exact weighting is proprietary to the index provider, S\\&P Global, the multifactor approach adds credibility to the index. There is no active management, no stock picking, and no manager discretion. It is entirely rules-based.\n\nSCHG is the only fund that tracks this index, and it is market-cap-weighted, meaning the biggest companies make up the largest portion of the portfolio. While its top holdings look familiar, with Nvidia, Apple, and Google leading the pack, it also includes names like Mastercard, Visa, GE Aerospace, and Eli Lilly, adding diversification beyond pure technology.\n\nAlthough SCHG launched in 2009, the Dow Jones Growth Index recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, providing us with ample historical data to analyze. Over the past two decades, the index has delivered a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 14% assuming dividends are reinvested, while remaining more diversified than the NASDAQ 100.\n\nThe S\\&P 500 also plays a starring role in The Core Portfolio. In 2025, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, and Amazon account for roughly 30% of the index, while the remaining 495 companies make up the other 70%. Standard & Poor’s reviews the index quarterly to ensure it remains representative of the U.S. economy. Companies must be U.S.-based, profitable for four consecutive quarters, and have a market cap of at least $20 billion.\n\nFor my S\\&P 500 exposure, I prefer the SPYM ETF due to its ultra-low 0.02% expense ratio. On a more psychological level, its lower share price compared to SPY makes it more satisfying to accumulate more shares, even though the percentage return is identical.\n\nThe Core Portfolio blends the growth and volatility of SCHG with the diversification and century-long track record of the S\\&P 500. Allocated at 60% SCHG and 40% SPYM, this mix has produced a blended 20-year CAGR of roughly 12.4%.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eeJ4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c28270c-c66f-4386-938b-ff258a85d8bf_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eeJ4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c28270c-c66f-4386-938b-ff258a85d8bf_1024x1024.png)\n\n{{caption:The Core Portfolio: a simple 60/40 blend designed to compound wealth.}}\n\nThe 60/40 split reflects a deliberate balance that prioritizes growth early without becoming overly dependent on any single index. As life progresses and timelines shorten, the allocation shifts as the capacity to take on more volatility lowers, because growth-focused portfolios carry additional risk.\n\nAfter the 2000 tech bubble, it took major technology stocks roughly 15 years to reach new all-time highs. While it is unlikely that an investor buys at the absolute peak, this level of volatility is not appropriate for money needed within the next five to ten years.\n\nThis portfolio is designed for young investors, particularly those using a Roth IRA, where investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are not subject to capital gains taxes. As investors age, diversification beyond large-cap U.S. equities becomes increasingly essential. But, that’s a conversation for another article.\n\nSo let’s do the math. At a 12% CAGR, one dollar invested at age 18 grows to just under $120 by age 60. At age 20, it becomes roughly $95. At age 25, about $50. At age 30, around $30.\n\nThat is the power of compounding over time. Small dollars from part-time jobs and teenage years can fund vacations, flexibility, and eventually retirement, especially when paired with the tax advantages of a Roth IRA.\n\nThe Core Portfolio exists to do one thing well: build long-term wealth without the stress of stock picking, high fees, or market timing. Boring, repeatable, and effective. Just like a good core workout.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
