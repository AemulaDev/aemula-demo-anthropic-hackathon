  "body": "I'm Zach Elwood. I write about political polarization and how we might build a less toxic, less divisive society. I'm the author of \"Defusing American Anger\" and \"How Contempt Destroys Democracy,\" and I'm the host of the psychology podcast People Who Read People.\n\n***\n\nI’m working on a book about reading people. It will be an offshoot of my [People Who Read People podcast](https://behavior-podcast.com), and use various quotes/observations from the various researchers and in-the-field practitioners I’ve talked to for that show.\n\nOne focus of the book will be discussing the many [bad](https://behavior-podcast.com/can-where-someone-looks-reveal-clues-to-lying-a-talk-with-deception-researcher-tim-levine/) ideas/takes on [physical/nonverbal reads](https://behavior-podcast.com/questioning-if-body-language-is-useful-for-detecting-lies-with-tim-levine/) of people promoted by various [“behavior experts.”](https://behavior-podcast.com/how-behavior-experts-lie-to-you/)\n\nIt will also delve into differences I see between [game/sport environments](https://www.readingpokertells.com/2022/01/podcast-episodes-about-sports-and-gaming-psychology-and-behavior/) and non-game (real-world) environments (e.g., why I think physical reads are clearly much more useful and reliable in game scenarios than non-game scenarios).\n\nIt will also include examples of reading people by making logical deductions of what people actually say (the content) and do; and argue that you’d be much better off focusing on that than ever focusing on nonverbal stuff (not to say that reading nonverbals is useless, but to say that in most serious, high-stakes scenarios you usually won’t get many useful, actionable clues).\n\n_Do you have examples of reading people in your job/career or personal life that come to mind?_ Instances where someone’s facial expression, nonverbal reaction, or something they said gave you actionable insight and adjusted how you approached a situation? I’d love to hear any examples you have, of whatever sort. There’s a chance I might include your story/example in my book or elsewhere, fwiw.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9gK4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9af994b-38f0-45a4-9e5a-3c5cc103eb17_924x518.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9gK4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9af994b-38f0-45a4-9e5a-3c5cc103eb17_924x518.png)\n\nOne example of a logical deduction came up yesterday. I saw that [Brent Ratner was taking heat for a photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAx5Ch22VQc) that seemed to show him and Jeffrey Epstein with two young women, whose faces had been hidden. Ratner defended himself and said that that was a picture of him and his ex-fiance; but he also didn’t want to name her so as not to drag her into limelight. I saw many people doubting him and saying things like “sure, likely story” but I immediately thought he was telling the truth, for the simple reason that if he were being deceptive about that photo and wanted to claim it was someone he personally knew (as opposed to a woman he had only met at a party) he almost certainly would have said that it was just a “girlfriend.” Saying it was his “fiance” is highly specific, and that makes the claim easier to investigate (e.g., researching his known long-term relationships at that time) and thus easier to prove/disprove. Deceivers, in general, prefer to use ambiguous language, as they don’t want to be pinned down; specificity can make statements easier to prove/disprove.\n\nNow, sure, I could end up being wrong here (I haven’t even looked into this story at all), but these are the kinds of logical deductions I think are most useful in the real world, when putting pieces together about things said in interviews and interrogations. And usually it’ll be the meta-level aggregation of multiple clues in people’s story/content (not a single clue) that will help people form pictures of what’s going on. And while these things are often not actionable (as you still want evidence and not just clues) they can have some practical value in directing one’s attention/focus and helping form follow-up questions and so on.\n\nDo you have little examples like this that led you in one direction or another when it comes to work/situations you were personally involved in, and that led to you taking one tack or another?\n\n***\n\nTo learn about my books on polarization, see <https://american-anger.com>, or see my Substack at <https://defusingamericananger.substack.com>.",
