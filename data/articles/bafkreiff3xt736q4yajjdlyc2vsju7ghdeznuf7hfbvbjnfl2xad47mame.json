  "body": "I wish that I could say that they come now and again or not at all, but that would be a lie. Sometimes they come out of nowhere. They come because of a photo shared or a song. A song that I hear on my created station or the untouched station in my mind. The latter affects me more because it cannot be shut off or swiped away. There’s no volume button or slide. These things are unwelcome guests. It’s been said time and again that it’s normal, it’s to be expected, but that hasn’t, doesn’t, and will never change my mind about it. I didn’t and don’t care about its normal or to be expected. I care about you being here with me. Without you, here, nothing is normal for me or expected as it once was. Every normal moment and expectation every daily or nightly norm and expectation is gone. They’ll never come back here. They’ll never come back here because you won’t come back.  You can’t.  It’s impossible for you to. I’ll tell you what is normal for me and what I expect-unrelenting pain and sadness. Moments, hours days, and nights of unrelenting pain and sadness. Moments when I can’t breathe or move. You would think that not breathing would be worse than loss of movement, but it’s not. Immobility lingers. Being unable to breathe or catch your breath doesn’t. I always knew and told others that if I lost you, I would be a wreck, devastated, and would never recover, and it’s true. There hasn’t been a day or night that has gone by where the pain hasn’t been present.  When the pain and Sadness haven’t been vocalized.  Dada said yesterday that it didn’t seem that long since your passing. It’s been almost four months. A realization of sorts came to me after his words: time spent in grief and sadness isn’t the same as time in anything else. I lay on my side of the bed staring at the ceiling through closed eyes. I struggle to describe this realization. How do I put it into words? I saw time differently for a few moments yesterday. The time since you passed isn’t and hasn’t been four months for me. Time has become a weird mixture of what I don’t know. The days are really years, and yet I feel at times as if you just died the other day.\n\nI’ve felt a deep desperation to be with you more than a few times. I feel as if I can’t breathe without you here, my sweet baby. My love.  You’ve been my life for 13 years. Thirteen wonderful, beautiful, and amazing years. Before you passed, I never thought about a time when you wouldn’t be here with me. I could never imagine, nor did I want to imagine, life on earth without you.  My wish was for us to go together, but that didn’t happen. God has assured me that you’re with him, and it did comfort me, but the intense pain and sadness seem to have dulled the peace and assurance that I had. I feel guilty and awful about that because I think that I’m questioning God and not in a good way. It’s still inside of me, but I can’t feel it as I did a few months ago. There’s nothing that doesn’t remind me of you nor remind me that you’re not here.  Looking at myself from the outside there’s a similarity between the thoughts and feelings that I’ve carried before you passed and now. Yesterday, I felt a hopeless desperation to be with you, to hold you again. I long for the day more than anyone could know or understand when I can hold you again, hear you purr, and see your beautiful, beautiful face, soft kitty- mama’s Buttercup.",
