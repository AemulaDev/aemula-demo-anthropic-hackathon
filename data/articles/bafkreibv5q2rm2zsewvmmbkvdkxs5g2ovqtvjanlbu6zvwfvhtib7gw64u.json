  "body": "There are times we have to deal with jerks or with people promoting dangerous ideas.\n\nThere are other times when we are the jerks and the ones with the dangerous ideas.\n\nJerks and people who promote dangerous ideas are often seen as threats, not as mild annoyances, and as such, harsh confrontation seems warranted rather than gentle persuasion.\n\nBut how are such confrontations received? When was the last time you were on the receiving end - someone else confronted you for your own behavior or ideas? Did you humbly admit you were wrong and promise to improve, or did you get defensive and try to justify your actions and ideas?\n\nMany people I know would prefer gentle persuasion to harsh confrontation. There are exceptions, to be sure. However, gentle persuasion distinguishes between a person and the ideas he or she holds. The person is accepted even though some of the person’s ideas should be rejected. Also, the person is seen as someone who loves truth and wants to improve, rather than someone who is apathetic or embraces evil.\n\nThere certainly are times for confrontation. After all, there are people out there who love evil and who live and breathe contempt for others not like them. Such people need to be shown that there are consequences for such attitudes and actions; in these cases, confrontation is appropriate and is the only language they truly understand.\n\nBut confrontation is rarely the right tool for the job, and its use often reveals that the person doing the confronting has acted too rashly:\n\n> _This_ you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak _and_ slow to anger; for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. James 1:19-20 NASB95\n\nThere are times when anger is appropriate, but we should take our time getting to that point. We are to be “quick” to hear and “slow” to speak and get angry. If we believe that anger is justified, “walking” in that direction is probably a good course of action - but first, we should “drive” to hear and understand the other person. Once we have confirmed that we have heard and understood the other person correctly, then “walking” towards anger may be warranted.\n\nMuch of the “driving” involves asking questions to understand both points of agreement and disagreement. After the other person has had their say, we might find that we actually agree with each other in whole or in part. Alternatively, we may find ourselves in total disagreement with the other person. When we agree with the other person, we should say so. Once we have noted points of agreement, then we are prepared to discuss areas of disagreement.\n\nThe aim is not to win a fight, but to win over the other person. This is not always possible, and sometimes we find ourselves in a fight despite our best efforts. But it should be our default option.\n\nDo you agree? If not, I’d like to hear your reasons why!",
