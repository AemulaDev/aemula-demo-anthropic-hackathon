  "body": "Recently, I decided to change the name of my publication from “Gene’s Substack” to “High Resolution Conversations”, which I discuss in this article:\n\n[Why \"High Resolution Conversations\"?](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/why-high-resolution-conversations)\n\nAfter about a week, I considered creating a separate version of the publication’s new logo, which helped me think about different aspects of discussing ideas in conversation with one another. This image, instead of using colored text, would instead use clear text with a high index of refraction. It would also use fog in the background along with a checkered floor.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RpxQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902bdc82-baf5-4d8f-b3a6-fc723f528bb7_1920x1080.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RpxQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902bdc82-baf5-4d8f-b3a6-fc723f528bb7_1920x1080.png)\n\nClear text with a high index of refraction allows for more interesting colors within the letters, which is analogous to more complexity and nuance in the topics we discuss with one another. This is in contrast to the solid-colored letters in the original image, which are much simpler. Additionally, the fog and checkered floor add complexity to the image as well.\n\nDue to the above factors, the alternative image took much longer to generate (32 minutes) compared to the original image (less than a minute). The takeaway from this is that quick, easy answers are not to be expected in subjects that have a lot of nuance and complexity. It will take time and effort to obtain accurate and worthwhile answers, and that is to be expected.\n\nHow might we aim for greater clarity and understanding in the topics we discuss with each other? What are some good practices we can adopt that would help us with that?",
