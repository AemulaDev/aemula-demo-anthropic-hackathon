  "body": "*This is the first in a series of Substack essays looking at Trump’s bullshit. Future installments will be available to paid subscribers.*\n\nTwenty years ago this month, the late Princeton philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt published his seminal work *[On Bullshit](https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Harry-G-Frankfurt/dp/0691122946)*, which argued that bullshit was worse than lying. His point was that a liar knows the truth and deliberately tries to hide or distort it, while a bullshitter doesn’t care about the truth at all — they care only about the impression they make.\n\nWhen Donald Trump emerged on the political stage in 2015, Frankfurt wrote in *Time* magazine that Trump was the epitome of the bullshit artist he had identified a decade earlier.\n\n“Trump freely offers extravagant claims about his own talents and accomplishments,” Frankfurt [said](https://time.com/4321036/donald-trump-bs/). “He maintains, for example, that he has the greatest memory in the world. This is farcically unalloyed bullshit.”\n\nWhen I managed The Fact Checker for The Washington Post, readers constantly asked: *Why rely only on Pinocchio ratings? Why don’t you call Trump a liar?*\n\nI thought “liar” was a conversation stopper — it would be my judgment that he lied. With Trump, it’s hard to tell. He might actually believe some of the stuff he says, or has convinced himself it’s true.\n\nThe one time [I clearly labeled a lie](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/23/not-just-misleading-not-merely-false-lie/) was when I had convincing evidence. Trump had insisted he knew nothing about hush-money payments to silence alleged paramours before he was elected president. Then his former attorney released a recording of Trump discussing an arrangement with the *National Enquirer* to pay $150,000 to one woman. Trump was caught on tape, so there was no doubt Trump had lied.\n\nBut, following Frankfurt’s theory, focusing only on Trump’s lies obscures a deeper danger to American society. As a bullshitter, Trump doesn’t care whether what he says reflects reality. He says whatever serves his momentary purpose, often contradicting himself without hesitation or shame. This indifference to truth makes Trump’s bullshit more insidious than lies.\n\nTrump is the dominant political figure of the past decade — perhaps of our lifetimes. Tens of millions of Americans support his policies, or at least disdain the policies of his Democratic opponents. In the last election, he narrowly won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. He views those victories as a mandate for a reordering of the federal government, with an unchallenged executive wielding vast power.\n\nThe danger is that Trump’s bullshit has become woven into the fabric of American life. Many citizens now struggle to discern reality from spin. Was January 6 a violent attack on democracy — or a peaceful protest demonized by the media? Was Joe Biden legitimately elected — or did Democrats steal the presidency in the greatest fraud in U.S. history?\n\nTrump bullshits to construct an alternative reality — one that almost half the country has accepted as fact. He has been aided by the balkanization of American society, where people live in blue or red zones and often absorb information that confirms what they already believe. Social media, unfiltered and often partisan, has replaced legacy media as a source of information.\n\nTrump’s handling of the Covid pandemic in his first term was disastrous, with the exception of producing vaccines in record time. Yet Americans seemed to erase that period from memory. Thanks to Trump’s relentless bullshit during his first term about having created the “greatest economy in history” — in reality, it was on the brink of recession when the pandemic struck — many Americans retained halcyon memories of Trump’s economic policies, especially once inflation soared in the pandemic’s aftermath.\n\nI often wondered how, if Trump had been re-elected in 2020, he would have explained the runaway inflation. I can only guess, but in any case, he would have spouted bullshit. Most economists agree Biden’s policies added some inflationary pressures on the margins, but pandemic-related supply-chain issues were mostly responsible.\n\nIn his second term, Trump has weaponized his bullshit. He is surrounded by lackeys who echo and defend his untruths.\n\nNo accurate damage estimate was available when Trump in June declared Iranian nuclear weapons sites had been obliterated. So when he made the statement he was bullshitting. In previous administrations, the results of such an attack might have received positive spin from unnamed officials, but since Trump is never wrong, once he puts it in his own words, the rest of government must twist its findings to conform with Trump’s claim.\n\nSometimes Trump gets lucky, and his bullshit turns out to be true. But more often than not, he just pretends he was right even when he was wrong.\n\nTrump in August fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics because job-growth estimates were revised downward — a common occurrence, especially if an economy is stumbling. Trump claimed the BLS director had manipulated the figures because she was a Biden appointee. That was bullshit. The BLS director cannot manipulate the job numbers, which are derived from surveys conducted by professionals many rungs below in the Labor Department. Yet Trump’s bullshit now threatens to erode faith in the accuracy of federal data.\n\nThat same month provided another example. Trump, desperate to win a Nobel Peace Prize ever since Barack Obama did, keeps claiming he ended six wars in six months. This is, of course, exaggerated, as [numerous](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/world/europe/trump-six-wars-fact-check.html) [fact checks](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/aug/05/donald-trump/stopped-six-wars-ceasefires-iran-israel/) have documented. But Trump took it a step further when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders visited the Oval Office and Trump explained to reporters why he had dropped his demand for a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n“If you look at the six deals that I settled this year, they were all at war. I didn't do any ceasefires,” Trump said.\n\nThat was bullshit. At least three of the conflicts on Trump’s “six wars” list were halted with ceasefires. But Trump needed to explain why he folded on his demand for an immediate ceasefire — embraced by Ukraine — in the face of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s charm offensive in Alaska last week.\n\nSo he just invented bullshit on the spot. The consequence is that Russia feels no pressure to end the war and can continue shelling Ukrainian cities. More people will die.\n\nAs part of this Substack, I intend to write a series of essays that examine specific examples of Trump’s bullshit and the consequences. I will likely start with Trump’s claim that he was a self-made business success — so central to the myth that carried him into office — but I also welcome suggestions from readers. Future posts on this theme will be limited to paid subscribers, so please consider signing up.\n\nTrump’s central tactic is saturation — flood the zone with bullshit until the truth becomes impossible to locate. I intend to create a record of what happened before it’s lost in a storm of revisionism and propaganda.",
