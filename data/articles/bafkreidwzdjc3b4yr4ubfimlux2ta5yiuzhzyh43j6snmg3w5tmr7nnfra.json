People just adapt.\n\nInstitutions do not weaken all at once. They weaken when people begin deciding what is safe to say, what is worth arguing, and what is better left unspoken. By the time those decisions feel routine, institutions rarely need to change publicly. They have already changed internally.\n\nFrom the street, the world looks stable.\n\nFrom the outside, permanence looks structural. Inside, it depends on how freely people speak, how often disagreement feels survivable, and whether expertise still outranks political instinct. When those signals shift, democracies rarely collapse immediately. They begin to behave differently.\n\nThat is where decline, when it happens, first takes hold—not in law, but in behavior.\n\n_**The collapse of a republic is not declared. It is absorbed.**_\n\nMadeleine Albright warned that modern authoritarian movements almost never present themselves as revolutions. They arrive framed as administrative correction—efficiency, accountability, reform. Timothy Snyder later described the same transformation from the citizen’s perspective, arguing that authoritarian systems advance when citizens begin obeying expectations that have not yet been formally imposed.¹\n\nOne year into Donald Trump’s second presidency, the United States has not experienced a constitutional rupture. Courts continue issuing rulings. Congress continues passing legislation. Elections continue occurring on schedule. The visible scaffolding of democratic governance remains intact.\n\nThe warning signs appear in smaller adjustments. And they tend to arrive in clusters.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, hours after returning to office, Trump reinstated Schedule F, a personnel classification allowing thousands of federal employees involved in policy work to be redefined as removable political staff. The administration framed the decision as restoring accountability over what it described as a resistant bureaucracy. Critics argued the move could expand executive authority over civil service protections.²\n\nCivil service has historically functioned as the memory of American governance, preserving regulatory knowledge and technical expertise across political transitions. Schedule F does not eliminate that institutional memory. It makes it conditional. Conditional memory hesitates. It recalculates. It begins measuring professional survival alongside factual accuracy.\n\nThe human consequences of that shift have appeared most clearly in individual cases where professional speech collided with political pressure.\n\nIn Massachusetts, U.S. Department of Agriculture employee Ellen Mei lost her job after speaking publicly about interruptions in federal food assistance programs during a government shutdown. Mei described how delays in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits affected vulnerable families. Her termination prompted protests and congressional criticism, raising broader concerns about whether federal employees could safely describe the real-world effects of policy decisions.³\n\nThe emotional consequences of that uncertainty appear repeatedly in reporting about federal workforce reductions. In an interview with WBUR, former federal employee Allison Hassett Wohl described the atmosphere inside agencies with unusual bluntness.\n\n“I’ve become sort of afraid of my own government,” she said.⁴\n\n_**Authoritarian systems do not require mass purges. They require professional uncertainty.**_\n\nHistorians of institutional decline often identify this phase as a loyalty threshold—the point at which professional advancement begins rewarding political alignment more reliably than professional independence. Democracies almost never collapse when this threshold appears. They begin speaking differently.\n\nInstitutional change never travels alone. It spreads through people before it spreads through policy.\n\nProfessional risk rarely remains confined to individual agencies. It diffuses through entire occupational networks—regulators watching colleagues lose jobs, researchers observing altered grant priorities, educators adjusting classroom boundaries, attorneys narrowing advisory language. Fear moves through professional communities faster than formal rulemaking moves through law. By the time policy shifts become visible, behavior often has already adjusted.\n\nDuring its first year back in office, the Trump administration issued more than two hundred executive orders, placing it among the fastest policy output rates in modern presidential history according to Federal Register tracking.⁵ Executive authority itself is not unusual. Every modern presidency relies on it. What institutional scholars watch is tempo. When policy decisions begin arriving faster than oversight systems and public comprehension can reasonably follow, governance shifts from deliberation to momentum.\n\nMomentum is efficient. It is also easiest to accept once it begins to feel ordinary.\n\n_**When power moves faster than citizens can follow, accountability becomes ceremonial.**_\n\nSupporters of expanded executive authority argue that bureaucratic accountability is overdue. They point to decades of public frustration with federal agencies viewed as slow, insulated, or resistant to electoral mandates. Advocates of Schedule F contend elected leadership must retain authority to align administrative policy with voter priorities. Those arguments carry weight in democratic systems built on electoral legitimacy. The tension emerges when administrative alignment begins reshaping the independence designed to stabilize governance between elections.\n\nA similar strain appears when federal authority collides with local governance.\n\nIn January 2026, Minneapolis became a flashpoint after federal immigration enforcement operations known as “Operation Metro Surge” resulted in the deaths of two residents, ICU nurse Alex Pretti and Renee Good, during confrontations involving immigration agents. The incidents triggered protests, investigations, and legal disputes between state and federal officials. Comparable tensions between federal enforcement priorities and local authority have surfaced in multiple American cities in recent years, but Minneapolis illustrated the conflict with unusual clarity.⁶\n\nThe dispute extended beyond immigration policy. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey warned fellow municipal leaders that silence from local governments risked inviting similar federal interventions elsewhere.⁷\n\nPolitical scientists track these conflicts as legitimacy fractures. When local and federal authorities present incompatible definitions of lawful governance, citizens begin deciding which government feels authoritative. Democracies can survive disagreement. They struggle when citizens begin choosing between governments.\n\nLocal reporting captured how these confrontations altered daily civic expectations. Residents described neighborhoods filled with tactical vehicles and surveillance helicopters, followed by uncertainty about whether federal authority would return and whether local officials retained meaningful control.⁸\n\n_**Fear does not spread evenly. It spreads where it is most easily justified.**_\n\nThe ripple effects extend into civic ritual. Town halls, school board meetings, and municipal hearings function as democratic muscle memory—repetitive public exercises reinforcing shared governance. When those rituals begin feeling unsafe or futile, participation weakens regardless of formal legal protections.\n\nNational survey data suggests that civic participation has been declining for years. A Pew Research Center survey found fewer than seven percent of Americans reported attending a local government meeting within the previous year, a figure that concerned political scientists because participation had been declining even before recent political polarization intensified.⁹\n\nThe most consequential democratic shifts rarely occur in government buildings. They occur in private calculations citizens make about what is worth the professional risk, the social conflict, or the personal exposure. Meetings are skipped. Conversations are softened. Public participation becomes something evaluated through cost-benefit analysis rather than civic expectation.\n\nMost of those decisions feel reasonable. They often protect professional stability, social cohesion, and personal security in the short term. That is precisely why they accumulate unnoticed. Very few people decide to retreat from public life all at once. Most simply begin adjusting to small discomforts until participation feels optional, and optional slowly begins to feel unnecessary.\n\nPolitical climates do not change because citizens agree with them. They change because citizens acclimate.\n\n_**The moment people begin adjusting themselves to power, power stops needing to adjust to them.**_\n\nComparative political research places these developments within a broader historical pattern. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt describe democratic erosion as institutional narrowing—the gradual repurposing of democratic structures without formally dismantling them.¹⁰ While scholars debate the speed and inevitability of democratic decline across societies, most agree that institutional behavior tends to change before constitutional architecture does.\n\nHistory offers warnings written in quieter ink.\n\nIn Santiago, Chile, during the early 1970s, journalists reported pressure to soften economic coverage and university administrators described curriculum changes designed to avoid political scrutiny before the military coup that ultimately overthrew democratic government.¹¹ None of those changes triggered immediate constitutional crisis. All of them prepared institutions to absorb one.\n\nThe United States remains structurally different from Chile’s pre-coup environment—its federal system disperses power, its judiciary retains significant independence, and its media ecosystem remains pluralistic. Historical comparison does not predict equivalent outcomes. It clarifies recurring mechanisms. Democratic erosion rarely transfers through identical events. It transfers through similar behavioral adaptations under political pressure.\n\nInstitutional shifts of this kind are often easiest to recognize years after they occur, when patterns that once felt isolated reveal themselves as structural.\n\nInstitutional behavioral change, once established, frequently survives the political conditions that produced it. Professional caution, civic withdrawal, and administrative consolidation tend to persist long after elections shift. Democracies sometimes recover legal balance faster than they recover institutional confidence.\n\nThe countercurrent remains real. Legal challenges continue. Investigative journalism remains aggressive. Municipal coalitions continue asserting local authority. American history contains repeated cycles of executive expansion followed by institutional recalibration.\n\nThe trajectory of the present moment remains uncertain.\n\nWhat history suggests, however, is consistent: democratic erosion almost never announces itself through catastrophe. It appears first through normalization—the quiet acceptance of political behavior that would have triggered alarm only a few years earlier.\n\nThe most durable political transformations rarely begin with citizens deciding to abandon democratic norms. They begin with citizens deciding that defending those norms feels increasingly impractical, professionally risky, or socially exhausting. By the time those calculations feel universal, they no longer feel like political choices. They feel like common sense.\n\n_**Democratic institutions do not disappear overnight. They disappear the moment people stop assuming they will survive—and stop noticing what has already begun to feel normal.**_\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1.
