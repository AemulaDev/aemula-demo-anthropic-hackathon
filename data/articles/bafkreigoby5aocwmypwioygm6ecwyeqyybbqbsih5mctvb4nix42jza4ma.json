  "body": "_“We must all unite, regardless of our political views, around a simple principle: political violence is never acceptable. Every person should be free to express their opinion without fear of violence.”_\n\n— Canada’s Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Poilievre\n\n_“Political violence, in fact, is political cowardice. It means you cannot convince people of the correctness of your ideas, and you have to impose them by force.”_\n\n— US Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\nThis is not a post _ultimately_ about Charlie Kirk or his assassination. The sheer volume of posts from people with a diversity of opinions, right and left, continues to fill the timeline of nearly every social media channel, and most national and even international news outlets. Views and analyses can be found in newspapers around the world, from the _Times of Israel_ to Australia’s “_[The Quadrant](https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/the-u-s-a/charlie-kirk-joe-rogan-and-gen-zers-for-trump/)_,” a favorite publication.\n\nThis is a post about the reaction and a feeble attempt to answer, “Now what?” Or, “what’s next?” It’s our next national debate, and how we resolve that question will determine whether our constitutional republic, built on the Declaration of Independence and governed by the Constitution, will survive.\n\nI know that sounds serious, even ominous. But it’s true.\n\nPerhaps Congress could amend events surrounding the 250th anniversary of our nation’s founding in 2026 by establishing a national debate tournament, built around this question: “_Resolved: Words can be equivalent to acts of violence_.” Or something like that. Let a random sample of Americans, representing diverse political leanings and demographics, sign up to serve as judges. Use national collegiate debate rules, and let Americans of all stripes develop two and three-person teams, and work their way to a final, nationally televised event, perhaps conducted at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where it all began.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WF99!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f0f3fa6-4380-49c1-9a13-f8601612d02b_1920x1080.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WF99!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f0f3fa6-4380-49c1-9a13-f8601612d02b_1920x1080.jpeg)\n\n*Independence Hall in downtown Philadelphia is where both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were negotiated and approved.*\n\nAnd if you’re on the negative side of that debate, as is Canada’s Conservative Leader, Pierre Poilevre, you’ll be starting _behind_. Way behind. _In the United States_, where the First Amendment protects the freedom of expression. _Allegedly, reportedly_.\n\nThat’s not just a problem. _It’s a threat_. It’s not that most Democrats agree to that dangerous notion, but that even a hefty percentage of Republicans do.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eZAH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b4ffbad-5dbe-4f7a-a03f-709efe119556_967x357.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eZAH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b4ffbad-5dbe-4f7a-a03f-709efe119556_967x357.png)\n\nAnd I’ve learned from political debates this: The debate matters less than the _reaction_ to it by the people and organizations that filter and curate the news. That’s what drives public opinion, in most cases. It is why the behavior and actions of the media - legacy and otherwise - matter. And the reaction to Kirk’s assassination matters more than the murderous tragedy itself, his family aside.\n\nLet me get this out of the way: When an 18-year-old Charlie Kirk burst on the scene about 13 years ago, I was immediately repulsed. _Who was this precocious provocateur?_ Like conservative pundit Guy Benson, I felt he should have gone to college and learned a few things about debate and persuasion. We were both glad to be proven wrong. I tuned him out early and often, until the Biden years, when I saw his organization explode in growth and finally grasped the method behind his madness, and the army of young people he was amassing to influence the 2024 elections.\n\nAn 18-year-old Kirk found the late [Foster Fries](https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-8482feb310e2d487afb293a32091070f), a Wyoming billionaire known for supporting conservative causes, including former US Senator Rick Santorum’s presidential campaigns in 2012 and 2016. Fries, impressed with the energy, intelligence, communication skills, and passion of the young firebrand, agreed to financially support the launching of his 501(c)3 organization, [Turning Point USA](https://tpusa.com/).\n\nIt was arguably Fries’s most successful political investment.\n\nI’ve never listened to a single Charlie Kirk radio show or podcast (that’s about to change). I didn’t read a single fundraising letter that flooded my mailbox (that’s also about to change, but I have a small stack of pocket-sized Constitutions he often included. I can never throw them away). But then, _Charlie wasn’t speaking to me_. He was talking to _his_ generation, and in his final months, the generation that followed. An [auto didact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism), He eschewed college after one year, taught himself on the history and principles of American and Western Civilization, became a devout Christian, married one, and lived a life he ardently advocated and defended on college campuses and even on one of the most challenging debate stages of all, at Oxford Union, where he took on a hostile crowd of 300.\n\nHe returned to dozens, if not hundreds, of college campuses, most recently with his “[Prove Me Wrong](https://tpusa.com/shows/prove-me-wrong/)” tour. He openly and invitingly debated with lefty college students not to persuade the people he was debating, but the people who were _watching and listening_. His audience was the hundreds, if not thousands, of college kids who attended, watched, and heard ideas and arguments they’d never thought of before. Sure, he was provocative, even incendiary in some circles. But due in large part to his deep faith, there’s _no evidence_ he ever advocated or engaged in violence. In fact, he eschewed it.\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlh_GfHmwts)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlh_GfHmwts) *[FULL VIDEO: Charlie Kirk VS 300 Oxford Students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlh_GfHmwts)*\n\nLesson one from the aftermath of Kirk’s murder: His effect on American politics and culture was not only significant, but felt increasingly _around the world_. Turning Point has global affiliates. Donald Trump owes much of his victory to Kirk’s almost single-handed effort to recruit and equip his generation, and the polling shows it. Especially among young men, with whom he resonated particularly well.\n\nKirk’s murderer has turned him into a martyr, which means his impact on the world is about to explode.\n\nOh, sure, some of the reaction on the right is way over the top, especially those showboating GOP House members who [introduced a resolution](https://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-nancy-mace-introduce-resolution-authorize-charlie-kirk-lie-honor-us) for Kirk to lie in repose in the Capitol Dome. It’s not without precedent, but _seriously_? Some are going too far with his _deification_. On the other side of the scale are deranged or malevolent conspiracy theorists, many of them probably foreign-operated bots, blaming Donald Trump (see: [Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/09/10/illinois-gov-jb-pritzker-blamed-trump-after-charlie-kirk-shot-presidents-rhetoric-often-foments-violence/)) or Israel. That’s _nuts_.\n\nYou can sum up the hateful responses from The Left™ with this: _he had it coming, and we hope his messages die with him._ Noteworthy is how many of the more hateful comments are resulting in firings and dismissals. Cancel culture seems to swing both ways, and I’m not sure that’s always healthy (in some cases, absolutely, and employers have the right to do so).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Tsr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e1d7295-d6a3-48da-8c1e-2e5116625050_732x738.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Tsr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e1d7295-d6a3-48da-8c1e-2e5116625050_732x738.png)\n\nI have no problem with Vice President JD Vance using Air Force Two to move Kirk’s casket from Utah to Arizona, and missing an event to commemorate another tragedy, the anniversary of 9/11, at Ground Zero. They were personal friends. And that’s something that’s really surprised me: just how many friends Kirk has. I’ve never seen so many posts and tributes with personal stories from scores of evangelical, political, and media leaders and colleagues, many of whom are my friends, too, such as his fellow Salem Radio colleagues (where Kirk had a radio show), Chris Stigall, Eric Metaxes, and [Hugh Hewitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqws6Mid0vI).\n\nThe Vice President’s tribute was among the most moving. Here’s a segment from his post on X:\n\n> Charlie Kirk was a true friend. The kind of guy you could say something to and know it would always stay with him. I am on more than a few group chats with Charlie and people he introduced me to over the years. We celebrate weddings and babies, bust each other's chops, and mourn the loss of loved ones. We talk about politics and policy and sports and life. These group chats include people at the very highest level of our government. They trusted him, loved him, and knew he'd always have their backs. And because he was a true friend, you could instinctively trust the people Charlie introduced you to. So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene. He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government. I was in a meeting in the West Wing when those group chats started lighting up with people telling Charlie they were praying for him. And that's how I learned the news that my friend had been shot. I prayed a lot over the next hour, as first good news and then bad trickled in. God didn't answer those prayers, and that's OK. He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly. You ran a good race, my friend. We've got it from here.\n\nOne consistent element among the responses to Kirk’s murder is the association of other events in recent memory, from 9/11 to other politically-inspired killings or attempts, to events such as January 6, 2021, and the George Floyd death and subsequent riots the summer before, especially from people on The Left\\*\\*™\\*\\* who are feverishly working to avoid being associated with the murder, and advocate the vacuous “both sides” argument. They should think carefully about doing that, and pay heed to the words of Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), who noted this in one of his recent press conferences (hat tip to Benny Johnson on X):\n\n> Utah Gov. Cox on the response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk: \"There was no rioting. There was no looting. There were no cars set on fire. There was no violence.\n>\n> \"There were vigils and prayers. And people coming together to share the humanity. And that, ladies and gentlemen, I believe is the answer to this.\n>\n> \"We can return violence with violence. We can return hate with hate. And that's the problem with political violence is it metastasizes.\n>\n> \"We can always point the finger at the other side. And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp or it's going to get much, much worse.\"\n\nWe reveal a lot about ourselves not just through our actions, but also through our _reactions_.\n\nAfter George Floyd’s death (I no longer call it a murder, at least for now, given [disputes](https://www.newsweek.com/george-floyd-autopsy-derek-chauvin-appeal-2001912) over autopsy reports), over 500 violent events were spread across more than 200 cities, resulting in over $2 billion in damage, along with injuries and at least one death to current and former law enforcement officials. The Black Lives Matter organization benefited from millions in mostly corporate contributions, only to squander them to buy [luxury homes](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/07/1091487910/blm-leaders-face-questions-after-allegedly-buying-a-mansion-with-donation-money) for its leaders, [an underreported scandal on steroids](https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/blm-finances-under-fire-only-33-of-donations-given-to-charities-as-execs-paid-millions-black-lives-matter-racism-bankruptcy-deficit-fundraising-fundraisers-george-floyd-breonna-taylor-patrisse-cullors-tamir-rice-fraud-scam).\n\nWhich brings us back to our debate: _Can words be equivalent to violence?_\n\nPlease put me on Team No. Make that Team _Hell No_.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of expression, including freedom of the press, mean nothing and raise a whole bunch of questions. _What_ words are “violent?” _Who_ decides what words are violent? And it invites a censorship regime that looks an awful lot like what’s going on in (formerly) Great Britain, and increasingly, Canada.\n\nUltimately, it’s about redefining the role of government from a guarantor of rights to one that giveth and taketh away our rights, as we see in Canada with its increasingly worthless Charter of Rights and Freedoms, brimming with “notwithstanding” clauses (exceptions). And if they ever get complete control of the government (all three branches), they get to decide who gets “rights” and who doesn’t.\n\n_Side note_: This is why it is critically important that the US Senate preserve the “filibuster,” which requires a super-majority to enact legislation. It requires a measure of bipartisanship in a closely divided U.S. Senate. We’re already paying a steep price for losing the filibuster for judicial and executive branch nominees, thanks _mainly_ to the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid in 2013 and his caucus.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wFPh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe217ef2d-d02b-4777-a4d9-2aa56457d45d_738x673.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wFPh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe217ef2d-d02b-4777-a4d9-2aa56457d45d_738x673.png)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FAjg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F913ca3db-a88b-4815-a716-155e7276e03d_737x788.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FAjg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F913ca3db-a88b-4815-a716-155e7276e03d_737x788.png)\n\nLet’s be clear. [The Twitter Files](https://americansforprosperity.org/blog/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-twitter-files/), exposed by independent journalists such as Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger, Bari Weiss, and others, provided clear and compelling evidence of an illegal and unconstitutional government censorship regime, including the FBI, attempting to suppress contrary opinions and evidence. Please pay attention to the _[Berenson v. Biden](https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/why-my-amended-complaint-in-berenson)_ lawsuit that is slowly making its way through the court system, because author and former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson experienced it firsthand.\n\nSome self-professed Christians on the left are among the loudest voices on Team Yes, who believe that words can be equated with violence. But their allegedly biblical perspective is wrong. James Menendez, a Christian blogger at Substack, [eloquently notes this](https://open.substack.com/pub/creationawaits/p/can-words-be-considered-violence?r=2yvflv\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=false):\n\n> Some might argue that Jesus' teachings on the connection between words and the heart's intentions support the idea that words can be violence. However, this interpretation misrepresents Jesus' message. Jesus was not equating words with physical violence; rather, He was pointing to the heart's condition as the true measure of righteousness. The anger and hatred that lead to harsh words are what concern Jesus, not the words themselves as acts of violence.\n>\n> Jesus’ message calls for a transformation of the heart—a change from within that would naturally lead to words and actions that reflect love, kindness, and respect for others. This is distinct from the modern concept that harmful words are themselves a form of violence. The biblical perspective recognizes the potential of words to harm, but it does not place them on the same level as physical violence. Instead, it calls for a deeper examination of the heart, where true violence originates.\n\nI think Charlie would agree.\n\nThe issue here, and Charlie spotted it immediately, was the increasing fragility of the minds of college students. Authors and free speech advocates Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt noticed this a decade ago in their famous 2015 essay in _[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/)_, “_The Coddling of the American Mind_.” It’s also the title of a terrific book.\n\nAnd this isn’t a partisan position. [Van Jones](https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/van-jones-excellent-metaphors/) said this in response to a question by David Axelrod about how progressive students should react to ideologically offensive speakers on campus:\n\n> I don’t want you to be safe, ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe, emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take all the weights out of the gym; that’s the whole point of the gym. This is the gym.\n\nAs Lukianoff and Haidt said in their article, “Free speech, properly understood, is not violence. It is a cure for violence.”\n\nAs with any debate of this dimension, there is nuance. Indeed, “fighting words” can incite violence, and there are [several Supreme Court cases](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fighting_words) that address it, some better than others. But even that can be used as a political cudgel, as we saw in the reaction of congressional Democrats who rushed to impeach Donald Trump after the Capitol riot of January 6th. Fortunately, the Senate rejected the House’s gambit. In most cases, “fighting words” are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also imposed a “[clear and present danger test](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/clear_and_present_danger)” on words that may incite violence. “The clear and present danger test features two independent conditions,” writes Cornell University’s Legal Information Institute. “First, the speech must impose a threat that a substantive evil might follow, and second, the threat is a real, imminent threat. The [court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/court) had to identify and quantify both the nature of the threatened evil and the imminence of the perceived danger.”\n\nAny accusation that Charlie Kirk incited violence or engaged in it is blatantly false. But there’s plenty of recent evidence of politicians who may be inciting people to violence.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dJtf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42749219-05c2-483c-956e-ff7af5f1ce90_633x727.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dJtf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42749219-05c2-483c-956e-ff7af5f1ce90_633x727.jpeg)\n\nIt’s too bad that Charlie won’t be around for this debate.\n\nWe’re all groping for strategies and tactics to the crisis we face, a deeply divided country that many believe is headed for another civil war. We’ve clearly veered off course, and there are many causes, from a breakdown of the family to violations of trust from our foundational institutions, from our schools to our churches. It was John Adams who said, \"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"\n\nIt starts with a moral and faith-based reawakening and recommitment to fundamental truth. It continues with a commitment to pick up Charlie Kirk’s baton of faith, freedom, courage, and civility, and stand up to those who would intimidate us.\n\nIt’s time for us to stand up and say, “I am Charlie Kirk.”\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCmyiljKo0)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCmyiljKo0) *[I'm Spartacus - Spartacus (8/10) Movie CLIP (1960) HD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKCmyiljKo0)*\n\n> _\"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\"_\n>\n> President Abraham Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865",
