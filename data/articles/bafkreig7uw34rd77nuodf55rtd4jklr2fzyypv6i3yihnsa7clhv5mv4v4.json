  "body": "I am honored to say that in the middle of 2025, the well-known economist Tyler Cowen gave me a grant through his fellowship [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures). I was in [cohort #43](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/06/emergent-ventures-winners-43rd-cohort.html). This grant was intended to support me to write more on Substack, and it’s been so helpful, even more than I expected. I want to say a bit about how this grant came to me and how it influenced my work here.\n\n### **How Did This Happen?**\n\nFor those who haven’t heard of him, Tyler is a famous blogger as well as being an economist. His main blog is called [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/). I’ve been an occasional MR reader for over a decade. In 2020, I was delighted that Tyler allowed me to interview him for the inaugural issue of [my magazine](https://thenewmodality.com/). (I have since retired that website, but you can [click here to see an archived version of the interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20200327075246/http://thenewmodality.com/the-economics-of-culture-values-and-meaning-with-bonus-covid19-predictions-interview-with-tyler-cowen/).)\n\nEarlier this year, I ran across [an MR post](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/10/classical-liberalism-vs-the-new-right.html) about the so-called “New Right.” (The post is from 2022, but as often happens with online media, it had a period of recirculation years after its original publication.) I have [thoughts about the “New Right,”](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-was-part-of-the-neoreactionary) and since I still had Tyler’s email contact from our interview, I emailed Tyler some of my thoughts.\n\nI was surprised and thrilled by how Tyler responded — he said he was a fan of my work! A _fan?_ Of _me?? Tyler Cowen???_ I was _so happy._\n\nI knew Tyler had a grant program intended to help small cultural ventures. And yet, even after he said he was a fan of my work, I was too shy to ask him for money right away. In the meantime, several acquaintances received grants through Emergent Ventures, and they all encouraged me to apply. They helped me scrape together my nerve, and I applied for money to do a second issue of my print magazine. Tyler responded saying that he is bearish on print magazines. He pointed out that I already had a (small) Substack, and he noted that he sometimes funds Substacks. I requested a phone call so that we could talk about it. The conversation went something like this:\n\nTYLER: I’m bearish on print magazines.\n\nLYDIA: I get it! That’s understandable. However, _my_ magazine is awesome.\n\nTYLER: I’m bearish on magazines as a category. However, I will once again point out that you have a Substack.\n\nLYDIA: I like magazines because they put the focus on the community rather than the individual. Also, I Have Plans for my magazine! It’s not just a print magazine! It shall be ✨media innovation✨! I have insights to bring to the entire media industry, which still hasn’t caught up to technological disruption and AI! Alongside the magazine, I will create a think tanky sort of thing, incubating a whole new culture. 🌟 Maybe we can also give _our own_ _grants_ someday!\n\nTYLER: Hmm. I think you should do Substack for a while, and see where it leads you. Maybe it will even lead you back to doing a print magazine.\n\nLYDIA: Magazine\n\nTYLER: Substack\n\nLYDIA: Okay fair enough.\n\nSo I re-applied for my Substack, and Tyler gave me a grant for my writing on Substack.\n\nI asked Tyler if he wanted to provide a statement for this post to explain why he gave me the grant, and he simply said: “Emergent Ventures gives grants to people we perceive as important talents, either now or in the future, that of course includes you.”\n\n### How The Grant Works and How It’s Influenced Me\n\nPrior to getting an EV grant, I suspected that it was a well-constructed philanthropic project, which intentionally does not tie up its recipients in red tape. This turned out to be true.\n\nMost philanthropic grants have at least one of the following problems: They are (a) chaotically administered, (b) slow to disburse cash, and/or (c) so bureaucratically complicated that receiving the grant is more effort than it’s worth. EV grants are not like this. The paperwork took me _less than a week,_ and _the money was wired directly to my bank account less than a week after that._ My entire reporting requirement is a one-pager to be filed a year after receipt. It is hard to overstate how awesome this is. I assume that this is possible partly because EV grants aren’t very large, in the grand scheme of things — we are talking tens of thousands of US dollars, not millions. But still. It’s awesome.\n\nI was grateful to receive both the dollars and the vote of confidence from Tyler. I was surprised to find the grant had a broader psychological impact than that.\n\nAs some of my long-term readers know, I spent some time being a [full-time blogger](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/a-couple-of-my-old-books-in-pdf), over a decade ago. Back then it was _extremely_ hard to earn a living that way, despite the fact that I was kind of famous; “influencer” wasn’t a word, and products like Substack didn’t exist yet. I tried many experiments, including self-publishing, but between the difficulty of earning a living and the general cruelty of online culture (including [cancel culture](https://www.emilybynight.com/p/how-i-got-canceled-by-the-left-and)), I burned out and switched to working in the tech industry in 2013. Since then, I’ve worked on a lot of digital media forms, but the business models are perennially weird (I reflected on this when I wrote about [the XOXO festival](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/after-xoxo-internet-art-and-culture) last year). There were years when I barely did any media work. But I always miss it when I’m not working on some form of media, even if it’s just a side project.\n\nBlogging is a strange and protean form. It’s not just writing. While there are writers of classic forms who do well on Substack by making words into essays, stories, and so on (I’ve been enjoying [Sherman Alexie’s poetry](https://shermanalexie.substack.com/)), blogging involves an element of connectivity. A link, for example, can utterly change the meaning of a sentence; a sentence can be the same string of words in print or online, but have a different meaning online, especially if the online version includes a link. The way blogging coalesces with the rest of social media can also be quite different when compared to print media; there are cool and frequently unexpected intertwinings among blog posts, and among other platforms like Twitter/X, and in the case of Substack, its own internal social media feed. But obviously one of the most significant things about blogging, overall, is that it is a less mediated connection between writer and audience; after I hit publish, readers see my posts within seconds and can leave comments immediately. I feel like the core innovation of blogging is actually that it’s just _personal in a different way._ All this is obvious, sort of, but as I’ve been constrained by connecting my efforts to money, I haven’t been able to play with this weird protean form as much as I would like.\n\nSo the _psychological_ impact of getting Tyler’s grant was that I felt suddenly _free,_ in a way that I haven’t in over a decade. This was great! I tried experiments I might not have tried otherwise, and not just on Substack but on other social platforms. I found myself making lists of posts I was excited to write, letting my mind run wild with online text experimentation, in a way that I haven’t since my twenties.\n\nThis also made me think more seriously about Substack as an income-generating project. Prior to getting the grant, I had a chicken-and-egg problem with Substack: Some readers already started sending me money before I asked for it (!!! thank you so much), but I had difficulty gauging the “correct” amount of effort to invest in this platform. And so, prior to the grant, I wasn’t investing in Substack much.\n\nEV grants are generally not huge, but still — receiving the EV grant from Tyler emboldened me to post on Substack more, to assume the support could be there if I took the time to create more. Also, Tyler is widely respected in my circles for his ability to identify talent, so this helps my other projects too.\n\nThank you Tyler!\n\n### Remaining Trickiness About Money and Substack\n\nBetween Tyler’s grant, and paid subscriptions that have ramped up this year, I am starting to earn noticeable money on Substack. I’m excited about this because it feels like a relatively non-problematic income stream.\n\nI have always been drawn to areas of human experience — art, [spirituality](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/spiritual-foods), [sexuality](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/a-couple-of-my-old-books-in-pdf) — where monetization is almost inherently problematic. I am committed to not monetizing my media work, or anything else, in a messed up way. As a result, I have turned down a lot of money over the years, and there have been several occasions I deliberately haven’t pursued “easy money.” Sometimes I can explain in words why I don’t want money from certain sources; sometimes it’s just a vibe. Having Substack subscribers and grants feels mostly fine, though.\n\nOne of the [science fiction writers I admire most](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/my-top-science-fiction-and-fantasy), Ted Chiang, has one of the smallest outputs. I have heard that this is because he categorically refuses to publish stuff until it’s totally done. Legend has it that Chiang once turned down a prestigious award because it was given to a book that his publisher pushed him to complete before he felt that it was done (in other words, both the publisher and the award-granting body thought the book was done and that he deserved an award for it, yet Chiang refused to accept the award because _he_ didn’t). I’ve also heard that Chiang gave up the opportunity to be a full-time science fiction writer at least once, because he was being such a purist about how money influences his work. I kind of idolize this.\n\nA common piece of advice to new bloggers is “post something every day.” I’ve always hated this advice. A minority of creators can maintain a high level of quality while posting every day on top of managing their everyday lives, but when most people try that, they simply make stuff that isn’t as good. So in most cases this advice adds to the level of bad content on the internet, thereby degrading the commons, and even worse, it tempts potentially good writers to put out bad material, thereby worsening their chances of success over the long term — though to them, it often feels like they’re getting more attention in the short term, so the problem is obfuscated.\n\nI think the willingness to turn down money is a good quality for me (and Ted Chiang) to have. But it’s problematic too. I am often stressed about money. And sometimes that stress circles back around and is bad for my work!\n\nAll of this becomes concrete when I try to think about Substack as an income-generating project, because the most obvious way to “sell a product” on Substack is to promise a certain number of posts per month. Given the rest of my life circumstances, I don’t feel like I can commit to a specific number of posts and also have all of them be good. But I feel bad when people are paid subscribers here, and I go a while without sending any paid posts. And if I’m serious about making money from my work here, then shouldn’t I make a commitment like this to my audience? For much of 2025, I’ve felt like I “should” set a minimum number of posts per month and I’ve also felt that I “should” paywall more, but ultimately I haven’t been able to force myself to do it. I truly don’t know if this is me being realistic about quality, or if I’m just being a prima donna!\n\nI’ve been worrying about this _a lot._ It’s part of a broader set of questions that I am working through about my media output, and the media in general. I’m publishing more posts about what it means to try and do good media work for money (one recent post was “[‘Healing Journalism’ and Notes Towards Community Media](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/healing-journalism-and-notes-towards)”). Whether I’m specifically talking about Substack, or about other media creation, a common thread is that producing work I feel is “good enough” is almost always (a) slow, and (b) hard to describe or “sell” in a way that I can get monetary support for.\n\nMaybe this means I should just, like, retrain as an accountant or something, and then write the occasional essay on the side. Maybe I’ll have to!\n\nMaybe the most I can say with certainty is that I’m doing my best to offer good work, and I am deeply grateful to everyone who is able to give me support for that, monetary or otherwise. (And if this makes you curious about creative ways you can support my various types of media work, I have a post called “[How And Why To Give Me Money](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-send-me-money-redux).”)\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
