  "body": "_When my youngest son and his bride-to-be announced they were engaged, they hit me with two requests._\n\n_First, to officiate at their wedding. And second, to wear my \"Prince Charlie.\" For the uninitiated, a Prince Charlie is formal Scottish attire, featuring the clan tartan and much more. See below for evidence._\n\n_Both requests were daunting. I wasn’t a minister (I am now, technically, sort of), had never officiated a wedding, nor was I familiar with New York laws on the matter. Second, I need to lose a significant amount of weight to fit into my formal Scottish attire that I purchased on a trip to Scotland 19 years ago for a 50th birthday family trip._\n\n_Mission accomplished. On Saturday, August 23rd, at the beautiful Kuyahoora Lodge in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, we celebrated the most wonderful and memorable events of our lives._\n\n_While I've been engaged in public speaking since high school, I found myself just as nervous as I was in my first extemporaneous speech more than 50 years ago. I spent more time on the homily than I did for any speech I’ve written, including those I wrote for two Secretaries of Transportation or any US Senator or House Member for whom I worked, or any of the two graduation speeches I wrote and delivered for my high school and college alma maters. It was that important and that meaningful._\n\n_After all, marriage is an institution established not by man, but by God, and is the foundation of our society._\n\n_Garrett and Juliana have permitted me to share my homily. I borrowed from several sources that I’ve linked at the end. It’s been lightly edited for clarity._\n\nHaving been married for 41 years, Adrienne and I have several shared passions. One of them is history, especially history about Great Britain and the British Royal Family. So much of their history influences our own.\n\nWell, maybe up until around July 4th, 1776.\n\nThere are a few great love stories among the royals. But in modern times, nothing captured the imagination of young women everywhere 44 years ago like the engagement and marriage of a young Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.\n\nThey announced their engagement on a cold February day in 1981, and immediately sat down for an exclusive televised interview. It only lasted 10 minutes, but it remains famous for one particular clip. The interviewer asks them if they’re “in love.” Diana responds quickly with a “yes.” Charles answered, however, with this: “whatever ‘in love’ means.”\n\n*[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lSmizRAe6A)* [|](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lSmizRAe6A) *[Charles and Diana Engagement Interview | \"Whatever 'in lovei means\" | ITN Exclusive (1981)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lSmizRAe6A)*\n\nTo this day, that remains a red flag, and I bet we all know the rest of the story.\n\nIt is safe to say that our prince and princess here would have responded differently. I think they know what being “in love” means. But what does it mean to be married?\n\nWhat is marriage, and why are we all here? And what makes for a successful marriage? And what is this “love” that is closely associated with marriage?\n\nWe’ve been treated throughout the years with all kinds of definitions of love and marriage. In 1960, the late author CS Lewis outlined the “Four Loves.” They include “storge,” or empathy; Philia, “brotherly love,” or friendship; eros, or romantic love; and most significantly, agape love, better known as “God’s love,” or _sacrificial_ love.\n\nGarrett and Juliana — it is a great honor to do your wedding service today. Garrett, it has been a great pleasure for your mother and me to raise you, and we could not be more proud of you. Juliana, we have been thrilled to get to know you, and we are so thankful that God has brought you and Garrett together. Proverbs says the godly man who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord — and that is undoubtedly true in Garrett’s case. Juliana, you are God’s gift to Garrett. Proverbs 31 asks, \"An excellent wife who can find?\" But Garrett has found one, and for that we all give thanks.\n\nGarrett, I think I can safely say that you married up.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n_KW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98d0f30b-922a-4149-b192-7a5944f656ee_366x640.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n_KW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98d0f30b-922a-4149-b192-7a5944f656ee_366x640.jpeg)\n\nJuliana and Garrett, all your friends and family are gathered here today because we love you and want to celebrate this day with you. Your parents, pastors, teachers, and many others have poured into you to prepare you for this day. Anyone who has seen the two of you together does not doubt that you were made for each other and that you’re ready to marry. Your friends and family would all say that your love for each other, your family, and your friends is supremely evident and inspirational.\n\nWe are gathered here today to witness and celebrate this union. No person or government created the institution in which Garrett and Juliana enter today. It comes from our creator God, and that gives it special status.\n\nFor this reason, Ephesians Chapter Five says, “A man shall leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife.” That’s heavy stuff. The Apostle Paul, the Bible’s most prolific author, later refers to marriage as “a profound mystery.”\n\n_No kidding_. It still is. But there are five things that the late Tim Keller eloquently spoke and wrote about marriage that I want to discuss quickly. These five main points he’s written and spoken about remain as relevant as ever.\n\nFirst, the _definition_ of marriage: It is a permanent and exclusive legal agreement – a covenant – to share _every part_ of your life.\n\nSecond, the _power_ of marriage: that comes from Ephesians 5, verse 21, where both the husband and wife are commanded to _submit to each other_. What does that mean? It means having a servant’s heart, or the ability to hear and give criticism with openness and without acrimony, and most importantly, the ability, the power, to forgive.\n\nThe most important words in any marriage aren’t “I love you.” It is “I’m sorry,” followed by “I forgive you.” Trust me on this; I have a little experience, especially with the former.\n\nIn any marriage conflict, someone is right, and the other is the husband.\n\nThird, the _romance_ of marriage is an _action_, followed by a feeling. That action is expressed in Dr. Gary Chapman’s famous “Five Love Languages,” including acts of service, gifts, quality time, words of affirmation, and physical touch. Each of us prioritizes this in our lives and relationships.\n\nDiscover – or rediscover – yours.\n\nFourth, the _priority_ of marriage is your spouse. Not your kids, not your parents, _your spouse_. Your spouse is the priority of your life. This is harder than it sounds, but it is really important.\n\nFifth, and last, the _primary purpose_ of marriage is friendship, or companionship. It is not a human invention to provide for your happiness. It’s to develop a deep oneness. That’s where the “profound mystery” that the Apostle Paul talked about comes into play. And you’ll be spending the rest of your married life unraveling that mystery.\n\nAllow me to share a couple of observations from the time Adrienne and I have been around you these past four, going on five years. Garrett, it is obvious that you love and cherish Juliana. You respect her remarkable skills, drive, intellect, and infectious personality. Juliana, it is obvious you respect Garrett, his competitive spirit, and his amazing ability to gather and nurture deep friendships. You don’t demand that he join you on hikes, or even create his own hiking “handle.” You give him his space to live out his ice hockey dreams, while he supports you in everything you do, from podcasting to hikes.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DJWU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b83bf7-664c-4526-a59f-5081cb3344ef_480x640.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DJWU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b83bf7-664c-4526-a59f-5081cb3344ef_480x640.jpeg)\n\n*Garrett and Harper.*\n\nYou’ve even let him adopt Harper. That is very cool.\n\nThere’s special pressure on marriages today because there’s too much focus on things that seem like love, but do not reflect what love truly is.\n\nFor example. The culture today too often equates love with physical intimacy, constant phone calls, obsession, frequent dates, and gifts and money.\n\nHere’s what love truly looks like, especially in marriage: respect, forgiveness, trust, sacrifice, commitment, mutual support, communication, and shared goals.\n\nAllow me to share a quick story from Adrienne’s and my marriage over 41 years, that demonstrates one example of what a successful marriage “partnership” looks like.\n\nWhen Adrienne and I married in 1984, not unlike our lovebirds here, we had our own careers. I was 27, she was 24, and we were both active in politics. It’s part of what attracted us to each other. Not even three weeks into our marriage - in fact, on the night we returned from our honeymoon - she got a call to go to Wisconsin to work on a Congressional campaign; I was already on the road in support of nine different congressional campaigns from Oregon to Long Island.\n\nShe left me. . . for Wisconsin. . . with my blessing and support. A year later, it was her turn, letting me go to lovely Texarkana, Texas, for another campaign. A year later, she headed to Austin, Texas, to run another congressional campaign. After that, we realized that hey, we had a marriage, and something had to change. Weren’t we supposed to be living under the same roof? She changed careers, and the rest is history.\n\nThe point is this: we supported each other and our careers, but we always put the marriage _first_.\n\nOur marriage was more important than either of us as individuals, and certainly more so than our careers. The same holds true for you.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6PGB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1241eaab-b8fe-4c2d-b088-dcdbdb8628ff_480x640.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6PGB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1241eaab-b8fe-4c2d-b088-dcdbdb8628ff_480x640.jpeg)\n\n*Juliana, wearing her mother-in-law’s altered wedding dress, with Garrett.*\n\nYou will experience peaks and valleys and challenges to your relationship. All of us who’ve been married for a couple of decades or more can no doubt remember them. The challenges and difficult times that come our way are unpleasant, even tragic. But they _should,_ they _must_, not break, but _deepen_ your relationships both to God and each other. For Adrienne and me, and this is important, the key to making it through these challenging times is _faith_. Our common belief in Jesus Christ as our savior and God’s eternal mercy has helped us through so much. Whatever you do, find a church and get involved. You will benefit from the support network that you will eventually need, I promise you, whether you give or receive.\n\nDave Ramsey, the famous Christian financial counselor, outlines four things that almost guarantee marital success: agreeing on how to handle money; agreeing on religion and regular church attendance; how many kids you want to have and, more importantly, how you want to raise them; and working out the relationship with extended family.\n\nParenting is the process of slowly letting go. This is the day, Garrett and Juliana, that both sets of your parents truly set you free. But don’t worry; we’ll still be there for you, for as long as we can.\n\nOne more thing, and _this is really, really important_: self-centeredness is the biggest threat to a successful marriage. If you make the marriage all about _you_ and _your satisfaction_, it will not succeed. As I said before, marriage is about _submitting_ to one another, which is another way of saying self-sacrifice, putting your spouse’s interests above your own. But there’s a funny thing about that; there’s nothing more rewarding than sacrificing your needs and wants for another person, especially your spouse. Giving is truly better than receiving.\n\nOur lovebirds here are about to make very public vows to engage in a permanent and exclusive relationship. And when I commence with the vows here in a moment, please know that you’re a part of this, too. As family and friends, you have a vital role to support and hold this couple accountable for the commitment you’re about to witness. You, too, will be making a vow to support this couple, as they’ve supported many of you who have already entered into this covenant.\n\nThe greatest poem in the Bible about love is family to most of us. “Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. . . it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.”\n\n_There it is_: the bond between love and the truth. It’s the truth within our love that gives us strength to “bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, endure all things.” And here is the scary part, that burns us with its fullness: “Love never ends.”\n\nLet's move on to the main event (the vows).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SfrZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ae1b5d2-6335-4b0b-ac8c-fd3109673ebe_480x640.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SfrZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ae1b5d2-6335-4b0b-ac8c-fd3109673ebe_480x640.jpeg)\n\n*The proud parents, Adrienne and Kelly*\n\n_Addendum:_\n\n_Links to Juliana’s podcast,_ _[backpacker radio](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/backpacker-radio/id1339028551)._\n\n_Sources of inspiration for this homily:_\n\n<https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-best-sermon-for-marriage>\n\n<https://www.gracemountvernon.org/qz8j934k6fv990/2017/2/25/a-wedding-homily>\n\n<https://www.frtommylane.com/homilies/weddings.htm>\n\n<https://coldcasechristianity.com/writings/why-marriage-ought-to-be-everyones-priority/>\n\n<https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-best-sermon-for-marriage>\n\n<https://deaconscott.com/wedding-homily/>\n\n<https://gospelinlife.com/series/marriage/>\n\n<https://theamm.org/>\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pRHG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5705f959-7109-4c38-94c0-8e5fb471d2ee_640x480.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pRHG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5705f959-7109-4c38-94c0-8e5fb471d2ee_640x480.jpeg)\n\n*The remainder of the Johnston clan, Elizabeth and our older son, Gavin.*",
