Drawing from proven methodologies of successful networks-from McChrystal's agile \"team of teams\" approach to Ehrlichman's decentralized \"impact networks\"-we outline three key stages through which such communities typically progress:\n\n- **Stage 1: Information Network**-establishing foundational trust through shared understanding.\n- **Stage 2: Action Network**-leveraging this trust to coordinate specific, impactful initiatives.\n- **Stage 3: Impact Network**-achieving systemic influence through self-organizing, widespread collaboration.\n\nEach stage builds intentionally on the previous one, setting clear milestones, addressing predictable challenges, and strategically progressing toward coherent societal impact. In the following sections, we provide detailed guidance, concrete examples, and clear checkpoints to help recognize progress and maintain momentum.\n\n## Stage 1: Information Network-Connecting and Learning\n\nThe catalytic community journey begins by forming a robust information network-laying a foundation of trust through mutual learning, shared language, and, most critically, alignment around a shared higher purpose. Success at this stage involves explicitly articulating and embracing a higher purpose that motivates and guides all subsequent efforts. From there, an open flow of information fosters a shared situational awareness about the trust crisis, enabling the development of a common vocabulary to communicate and discuss trust-related challenges, and establishing initial personal relationships that are vital for sustained collaboration.\n\n**Key Objectives:**\n\n- Establish a shared higher purpose (the community's North Star) that unites stakeholders and inspires commitment beyond individual interests.\n- Create a shared situational awareness around the state of trust in society and a common language.\n- Foster initial interpersonal trust and credibility among diverse actors.\n- Identify shared values and initial points of consensus.\n\nIn this first phase, the emphasis is on connecting people and sharing knowledge. The community forms an information network that builds a shared situational awareness and rapport among members. Stakeholders who might never have interacted-for example, a data scientist, a journalist, and a philanthropist-begin to exchange perspectives and information. Through forums, workshops, and online platforms, they share research, personal stories, and insights about the nuances of trust. This creates a shared context and language. This work is already underway at the Trust Foundation.\n\nEarly on, it's crucial to surface differences in viewpoint while also highlighting common ground and values through deliberate \"sensemaking.\" For example, in one regional environmental network, conveners held confidential pre-meeting conversations, allowing participants to voice their fears and hopes candidly. Despite diverse priorities, they discovered a meaningful amount of common ground and agreed that stronger connections would benefit all.\n\nSuch preparation lays the groundwork for an initial reservoir of trust. Members see that others are listening and that knowledge flows freely without an agenda. The network at this stage is loose but growing \"*at the speed of trust*\"-trust-building cannot be rushed. Early wins here might simply be learning together: mapping the problem, identifying leverage points, and feeling part of a larger whole. For example, in Vermont, an online bulletin board called Front Porch Forum was started to connect neighbors and swap news and tips. Over time, these information exchanges cultivated a baseline of familiarity and goodwill. When a crisis hit-a major flood-that simple network suddenly became the community's lifeline, the go-to place for sharing emergency information and resources. This illustrates the power of networks of information and empathy as the seedbed for collective action\\[1\\].\n\n**Anticipated Challenges:**\n\n- **Participants often bring distinct personal or institutional objectives**-clarifying the community's shared higher purpose explicitly at the outset helps transcend individual agendas and align diverse interests.\n- **Building genuine trust takes time**-embracing incremental progress and celebrating small successes reinforces commitment.\n\nArticulating and aligning around a shared higher purpose isn't merely beneficial-it's foundational. It sets the stage for everything that follows. Only once stakeholders are genuinely united under a compelling, shared vision can the community effectively transition to coordinated collective actions, the hallmark of Stage 2.\n\n## Stage 2: Action Network-Coordinating Decentralized Action\n\nWith a clearly articulated shared higher purpose, trusted relationships, and shared understanding established, the community transitions from foundational learning into active collaboration. In Stage 2, the community becomes an Action Network, mobilizing small, empowered task forces to deliver concrete, tangible outcomes aligned with the overarching goal of trust restoration.\n\nA pivotal enabler at this stage is the Trust Syndicate, an angel network under the auspices of the Trust Foundation, specifically designed to direct capital and resources toward ventures and innovations that advance the community's goals of rebuilding social cohesion, reinventing institutions, and transforming our information ecosystem. The syndicate leverages the wisdom of the community to direct investment into the most promising initiatives emerging from or supported by the network, creating a powerful synergy between nonprofit community-building and for-profit innovation.\n\n**Key Objectives:**\n\n- Mobilize cross-sector, empowered task forces around specific trust-related challenges.\n- Translate trust, knowledge, and shared purpose from Stage 1 into practical, impactful initiatives.\n- Maintain decentralized autonomy while ensuring alignment with community goals and values.\n\n**Readiness Criteria:**\n\n- Clearly articulated and embraced shared higher purpose and community values.\n- Demonstrated initial trust and interpersonal bonds across diverse stakeholders.\n- Established infrastructure for ongoing communication, coordination, and resource allocation.\n\nWith trust and shared understanding established, the community can graduate to an action network. In Stage 2, members mobilize and collaborate on specific initiatives. This often involves forming cross-functional task forces or working groups focused on tangible projects or policy changes that align with the community's mission.\n\nConverting talk into action is the theme of this phase. The transition typically involves clarifying a common agenda (e.g., agreeing on priority areas to tackle) and then empowering smaller teams to execute. It's analogous to moving from a talk shop to a workshop: the community not only discusses problems but starts building solutions together.\n\nEffective action networks maintain the open, decentralized ethos of Stage 1 while introducing a layer of coordination that ensures efforts align rather than conflict. A useful concept here is \"minimum viable bureaucracy\"-just enough structure to organize work without stifling creativity or ownership. For instance, the community might establish simple protocols for launching a task force: any group of, say, five or more members that identifies a trust-related challenge can propose a project, and if it attracts sufficient interest and fits the shared purpose, it gets the community's blessing (and possibly seed capital) to proceed. These task forces act as autonomous teams within the larger network. Each team sets goals, divides roles, and pursues a project, periodically reporting back to the entire network for feedback and learning.\n\nCrucially, action networks still rely on decentralized decision-making- no central authority micromanages the teams. Instead, the community fosters a culture of \"*empowered execution,*\" as McChrystal terms it. Because everyone in the network has context and trusts one another (thanks to Stage 1), task forces can make informed decisions quickly and effectively. For example, during the growth of the civic tech collective g0v (Gov Zero) in Taiwan, volunteers self-organized into project teams to address issues of government transparency and public participation. This grassroots network, which began as a loose group of hackers sharing ideas, soon spawned tools such as a budget visualization website (to make government spending data more accessible) and facilitated the famous vTaiwan online consultation process for citizens\\[2\\]. These were not top-down assignments-they arose organically from the community. Government officials even came to g0v asking for help after seeing its success in the 2014 Sunflower Movement, leading to unprecedented collaborations (one g0v member, Audrey Tang, became the Digital Minister). The g0v community demonstrates Stage 2 dynamics: empowered teams working on concrete solutions (from open-source software to new public forums) under a unifying mission of \"radical transparency\" and civic empowerment.\n\nOur catalytic community will also incubate projects in areas such as community cohesion (e.g., building platforms for neighbors to deliberate on local issues), trustworthy institutions and institutional forms (e.g., what is trustworthy journalism?), or technology (e.g., frameworks for trustworthy AI). Each effort will be led by those who are passionate and knowledgeable in their respective domain but connected to all others through the overarching network. By Stage 2, our community shifts into a problem-solving mode-it becomes an action-oriented coalition.\n\n**Anticipated Challenges:**\n\n- **Task force redundancy or conflict**-transparent dashboards and regular leader forums that enable early identification and resolution of potential overlaps or conflicts help avoid duplication.\n- **Resource competition between task forces**-encouraging collaborative resource pooling and explicit alignment with the overarching purpose ensures that resources support collective priorities rather than isolated agendas.\n- **Loss of alignment by task forces**-reinforcing the shared higher purpose through consistent messaging and periodic reviews of task force objectives against community-wide OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).\n\nUltimately, Stage 2 operationalizes the trust, cohesion, and alignment cultivated in Stage 1. By forming empowered, decentralized task forces with clear alignment and structured autonomy, the community translates intention into impactful, practical results, building momentum toward the systemic impact characteristic of Stage 3.\n\n## Stage 3: Impact Network-Achieving Coherence at Scale\n\nIn Stage 3, the catalytic community evolves into an Impact Network, achieving systemic and widespread influence through sustained, coherent collective action. At this mature stage, the community behaves like a dynamic ecosystem-capable of rapidly organizing responses to emergent trust challenges without relying on central coordination. The collective stewardship, distributed leadership, and self-organizing capabilities nurtured in earlier stages come fully into play, generating sustainable and scalable societal impacts.\n\n**Key Objectives:**\n\n- Self-sustaining engagement with a critical mass of diverse stakeholders actively participating and organic expansion into new areas or regions.\n- Emergent responsiveness as the community spontaneously identifies and responds to new issues, quickly mobilizing task forces or initiatives without centralized direction.\n- Collective stewardship through shared ownership and accountability ensures coherent governance and persistent alignment with the overarching higher purpose.\n\nIn the final stage, the network achieves the status of a true catalytic community. The many threads of action begin to weave into a sustained, coherent impact at a systemic scale. A Stage 3 network is not just running isolated projects; it actively influences systems-whether social norms, public policies, or industry practices-and continues to do so over time. Several markers signal that a community has reached this level of maturity:\n\n- **Widespread engagement and scale**-the network has grown to include a critical mass of stakeholders. It may have spawned regional or thematic sub-networks that emulate the approach beyond its initial scope. In our context, a mature catalytic community might have chapters in multiple regions or sectors, all connected through shared principles and values.\n- **Emergent, self-organizing activity**-at this stage, the community operates with a high degree of self-generativity. New collaborations form spontaneously as members identify needs and trust that others will support them. The network can respond to emerging crises or opportunities without waiting for central direction. A catalytic network sees emergent solutions take shape rather than following a rigid blueprint. For example, suppose a sudden wave of misinformation sparks public confusion. In that case, a well-developed trust network might rapidly assemble a cross-platform response team (media folks, educators, techies) to address it-without being \"assigned\" from above. Flexibility and speed are the hallmarks of these advantages.\n- **Collective stewardship and culture** (despite further decentralization of the community)-maintain cohesion through shared values and accountability. Members feel a sense of collective ownership of the mission (e.g., \"we are all responsible for restoring trust beyond our individual projects\"). Norms of reciprocity and transparency keep everyone aligned. Mature networks often establish a lightweight governance system-for instance, an elected council or rotating \"stewards\"-to uphold values and mediate as needed. But leadership in Stage 3 is mostly distributed and facilitative: those with expertise or social capital step up to guide on particular issues, then step back. In the words of General McChrystal, leaders become \"*gardeners*\" rather than chess masters, cultivating an environment for the team to thrive toward a shared goal. They empower others instead of directing every move. This fosters a virtuous cycle: as trust begets trust, the network's influence grows and attracts even more participants and resources, reinforcing its ability to catalyze change.\n\nWhen a community reaches this level, it can truly tackle system-wide challenges. It behaves like a movement or ecosystem, not a single organization. Our vision is that the catalytic community will become a sustaining platform for innovation and action on trust issues long after its initial projects. In the long run, success means changing societal patterns-e.g., making participatory governance, community forums, and cross-sector partnerships the new norm in decision-making, thereby embedding trust into the fabric of daily life.\n\n**Anticipated Challenges:**\n\n- **Governance complexity**-using modular, lightweight governance frameworks helps to accommodate growth without bureaucratic burdens.\n- **The risk of fragmentation**-regularly convening community-wide gatherings that emphasize shared purpose and core values will be critical to maintaining coherence and mitigating mission drift.\n- **Ensuring alignment**-periodic mission audits or stewardship dialogues can continually reinforce the community's shared higher purpose.\n\nReaching Stage 3 is a continuous process. Even as we strive for systemic impact, we expect to cycle through the earlier stages to continually address new challenges-connecting with new people, launching new actions, and scaling further. The process is iterative and dynamic. Yet, each iteration strengthens the community's capacity and credibility.\n\nTo funders and policymakers, the message is that investing in this evolutionary process yields compounding returns: early support for convening and network building (Stage 1) leads to collaborative innovation and solutions (Stage 2), which, if successful, can evolve into large-scale systemic changes (Stage 3). We are already seeing signs of Stage 3 in certain areas. For instance, Taiwan's g0v community has influenced national digital policy, and Front Porch Forum now covers every town in Vermont and is being eyed as a model for use beyond. By learning from these cases and intentionally guiding our community through the stages, we can create a catalytic network of networks that turns the tide on the trust apocalypse.\n\n***\n\nComing Next-Initiating the Community\n\n***\n\n\\[1\\] The friendliest social network you've never heard of, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/10/front-porch-forum-vermont-research-new-public/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/10/front-porch-forum-vermont-research-new-public/) (accessed June 19, 2025).\n\n\\[2\\] How Taiwan's 'civic hackers' helped find a new way to run the country, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/27/taiwan-civic-hackers-polis-consensus-social-media-platform](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/27/taiwan-civic-hackers-polis-consensus-social-media-platform) (accessed June 19, 2025).\n\n***\n\n*To read more and support or subscribe directly, find all the Trust Apocalypse work on [Substack](https://trustapocalypse.substack.com/).*",
