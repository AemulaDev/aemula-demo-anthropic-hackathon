Illinois State Board of Elections_. No ballots appeared or vanished. No machines were adjusted. No deadlines quietly slid.\n\nWhat it changed was something subtler—and more destabilizing: who gets to keep an election from ever quite ending.\n\nOn January 14, the Court ruled that any candidate for federal office can challenge the rules used to count votes in their election, even if they cannot show that those rules affected the outcome.¹ The harm, the Court said, is not necessarily losing. It can be something looser and more subjective: damage to the election’s legitimacy.²\n\nThat sounds abstract until you look at how elections actually play out now.\n\nFor most of modern American history, elections concluded. There were winners, losers, and usually a brief spell of protest before the country moved on. Courts intervened when something clearly broke. One quiet reason this worked was a basic rule: to sue, you had to show that what you were challenging had harmed you in a real, concrete way.\n\nIf a candidate lost by a mile, judges had little interest in arguments about envelope markings or counting routines. The election ended. The system advanced.\n\n_Bost_ loosens that rule.\n\nUnder the new standard, a candidate no longer needs to show that a voting rule flipped a race—or even that it plausibly could have. It is enough to say the rule governed their election and that it weakened public confidence. In a country already primed for suspicion, that is a remarkably low threshold.\n\nThe Court presented its reasoning as a stabilizer. Let candidates challenge rules earlier, before votes are cast, and disputes can be resolved in advance, reducing post-election turmoil.³ On paper, the logic is tidy.\n\nIn practice, it misreads how modern elections are fought.\n\nSince 2020, elections have stopped being single events and started behaving like extended dramas. Counting night is only the opening scene. What follows is a slow churn of lawsuits, press conferences, filings, and insinuations that can stretch on for weeks. In this environment, delay is not a malfunction. It is leverage.\n\nKeeping an election unresolved—legally, rhetorically, emotionally—serves a purpose. It keeps supporters engaged. It sustains doubt. It prevents outcomes from hardening into fact.\n\nStanding—the rule that determines who may sue—was one of the few procedural brakes on that strategy. After the 2020 election, many challenges failed not because judges declared the system flawless, but because plaintiffs could not show that the alleged problem actually changed anything.⁴ _Bost_ removes that brake.\n\nThe Court appears to believe that early lawsuits will crowd out later ones. In a low-trust environment, the opposite tends to happen. Pre-election challenges do not replace post-election claims of illegitimacy; they layer on top of them, creating parallel tracks of legal dispute and public narrative.\n\nAnd this matters even when elections are not close.\n\nPicture a congressional race decided by several points—enough to make recounts beside the point. Under the old rules, that margin helped close the door. Courts were unlikely to entertain challenges to minor procedures when the outcome was unmistakable. Under _Bost_, the margin no longer performs that function. The claim need not be that the result was wrong—only that the process that produced it was questionable.\n\nThat alone can keep the fight alive.\n\nThe timing sharpens the risk. The decision arrives as voting itself has grown more complex. Mail voting—now routine—depends on logistics most voters never see. A ballot can be cast on time and still arrive late. A postmark can be applied far from the voter’s home. Nothing improper occurs, but the paperwork looks off.⁵\n\nWhere these quirks were once treated as administrative realities, they now read as invitations.\n\nThe Court is also not finished. Later this year, it will hear another case that could limit whether states may count ballots that arrive after Election Day, regardless of when they were cast.⁶ If the Court narrows that rule, it will give candidates an even sharper incentive to contest results—and more reason to prolong disputes.\n\nMeanwhile, state governments have been quietly rearranging who controls election certification and oversight, often in the name of restoring trust. The effect is to add choke points. More officials can be pressured. More decisions can be challenged. More moments can be slowed.⁷\n\nThis is not what election rigging looks like anymore.\n\nNo one needs to alter votes. They only need to stretch time.\n\nAn election that drags on for weeks begins to feel suspect, even when nothing is amiss. A result announced under constant legal threat feels temporary, even when final. Courts pulled into arguments over “legitimacy” inevitably become part of the spectacle they are meant to resolve.\n\nTwo Supreme Court justices warned about this directly. One argued that the Court was turning a shared civic concern—fair elections—into a personal weapon for candidates, inviting judges into political fights they are ill-suited to referee.⁸ Another agreed the plaintiffs could sue but rejected the broader reasoning as unnecessary and unstable.⁹\n\nThose disagreements matter less for what they forecast than for what they expose: even the Court is unsure how far this new rule should reach.\n\nThe Court says it wants clarity. It may instead have rewarded endurance—favoring those willing to litigate longest, generate the most noise, and keep an election from ever fully settling.\n\nNone of this guarantees chaos in 2026. Votes can still be counted honestly. Courts can still dismiss bad claims. Election workers can still do their jobs.\n\nBut the rules now favor actors who treat elections not as events to conclude, but as processes to prolong.\n\nAmerican democracy has weathered bad actors before. What it struggles to survive is fatigue.\n\nIf the next midterms feel different—not louder, but slower; not more dramatic, but harder to put to rest—this decision will be part of why. Not because it changed how Americans vote, but because it changed how long the country is expected to wait for an election to be over.\n\nAnd in today’s politics, waiting is rarely neutral.\n\n⸻\n\nBiibliography\n\n1.
