  "body": "_Satire alert._\n\nDelcy Rodriguez, the new interim President of Venezuela, frantically fumbled through the desk of her now-departed leader, Nicolas Maduro, when she heard a faint ringing noise. For a nation’s second-in-command, she was woefully unprepared for this moment and unfamiliar with her new surroundings.\n\n“_¿Qué es eso?_” “_What is that_?” Rodriguez blurted as she looked up. “MARIA!” she yelled, calling for her one, lone assistant. There was no one else to be found in the Venezuelan Palacio de Miraflores, the official presidential offices of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Just hours before, Maduro had been captured at La Casona, the official residence of the President and carefully guarded for more than a decade by a large platoon of over 30 Cuban intelligence officers, all of whom were dead or missing.\n\n[![undefined](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRhK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4b6f56-e308-45c5-b53f-3b420bb4dcdb_2275x1280.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YRhK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4b6f56-e308-45c5-b53f-3b420bb4dcdb_2275x1280.png)\n\n{{caption:Palacio de Miraflores, the official presidential offices of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela}}\n\nNone of Maduro’s Russian or Iranian security officials could be found, either. Rodriguez wasn’t surprised - she knew they’d cut and run at the first sign of trouble, as the senior aides suddenly chose to “return home for the Holidays” as US warships began encircling Venezuelan ports, especially the Russians - even the Iranians, who didn’t exactly celebrate “The Holidays.” The Iranian and Chinese aides, with the oil embargo in full effect, took the cue and made a beeline for Simon Bolivar International Airport. Just hours before Maduro’s capture by US Army Special Forces, a nervous Chinese delegation met where an agreement to hash out Venezuela’s membership in China’s “[Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/gjhdq_665435/3447_665449/3538_665158/3540_665162/202407/t20240702_11445880.html)” was being hammered out, unsuccessfully, given Venezuela’s poor financial situation.\n\nThe Chinese were suddenly getting cold feet about investing in Venezuela.\n\nSo much for these new “friends,” Rodriguez thought.\n\nRodriguez, Maduro’s former foreign minister, was oddly uninvited to that meeting. She suspected Maduro was looking to join the Chinese on their one-way trip home. The nervous Chinese politely declined Maduro’s suggestion and said consultations with the foreign ministry were required before that happened. “_You have a problem_,” the Chinese emissary was reported to have said. “_We have a plane to catch_.” There were no direct flights to China from Venezuela - only through Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nThat impenetrable, steel-girded underground rooms had been installed that could survive a nuclear attack didn’t matter. Maduro failed to reach them in time from his bedroom three stories above before US troops showed up to block his way, and be ushered aboard the US Iwo Jima and a New York City “detention center.”\n\nRodriguez had been awakened around 1:30 a.m. that morning by the cacophony of fighter jets, hums of helicopters, and explosions occurring less than a mile from her Caracas home. It was confusing and disorienting. It wasn’t until a Venezuelan military aid stationed outside her home knocked on the door two hours later and gave her the news: “_Se llevaron al presidente_,” he said (“they took the president”).\n\nRodriquez had only her personal secretary with her in the empty building, along with a few still-loyal but confused The interim President was hastily “officially installed” by Maduro’s handpicked Supreme Tribunal of Justice before they, too, scattered to “safe houses.” In an increasingly paranoid society, Maduro's officials each have their own private escapes and hideaways, although the CIA knew _exactly_ where they were.\n\n[![(FILES) Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez speaks during the presentation of the 2025 budget bill at the National Assembly in Caracas on December 3, 2024.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sUm5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aec015a-bec3-49bd-a8e9-ce368726b50e_500x333.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sUm5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4aec015a-bec3-49bd-a8e9-ce368726b50e_500x333.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Delcy Rodriquez, Venezuela’s interim President, in the shadow of the late Hugo Chavez}}\n\nMaria ran into the room when Rodriguez found an old rotary-dial phone beneath a pile of papers written in Farsi. “I found it. I wonder who is calling? _Maybe it’s Nicolas_.\n\n“_Hola_?” Delcy asked her as she brushed her long, dark hair back over her 56-year-old shoulders. “_¿quién es?_” “Who is this?”\n\n“_Por favor, espere un momento para hablar con el secretario Rubio,_” the secretary said in perfect Spanish. “Please hold for Secretary Rubio.”\n\nDelcy gasped as she realized who was about to get on the phone. _Here it comes_, she thought.\n\nShe heard a click as the US Secretary of State quickly said, “_Hola, señora presidenta, ¿cómo está?”_\n\nDelcy was taken by Rubio’s almost friendly, even buoyant manner. He even referred to her as the President, which surprised her. She wasn’t surprised by his fluency in Spanish, since it was Rubio’s first language as a young boy, growing up as a child of Cuban refugees. She’d always been impressed by the 54-year-old American politician and his personal story, whom she considered Venezuela’s most formidable international adversary. She found him rather. . . attractive, even mesmerizing. _And she hated him._\n\nShe remembers warning Maduro after Rubio was nominated as Secretary that rough days were ahead.\n\n_That was an understatement_. She remembered telling Maduro, as he fumbled with his TV remote while watching Rubio’s Senate confirmation hearing nearly a year ago, that the new Secretary’s lifelong dream, his mission, was _viva libre Cuba_ - a free Cuba. And the path to that ran through Caracas, on whose heavy oil Havana was _deeply dependent_. That’s why Cuban intelligence was so embedded in and around Maduro, aside from the reality that _Maduro couldn’t trust his own Venezuelan security forces_. She remembered that Maduro had tuned her out between sips of his salt-rimmed margarita. He’d also tuned out the people of Venezuela, who by and large _hated him_.\n\n[![Venezuelans celebrate Maduro capture after President Donald Trump  announcement | Fox News](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N7_1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe887a5e1-77f0-4eda-abfa-bc73b546a61e_1200x675.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N7_1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe887a5e1-77f0-4eda-abfa-bc73b546a61e_1200x675.jpeg)\n\nBefore Delcy could respond, Rubio continued. “Look, let me get right to the point. First, let me assure you of your personal safety.\n\n_Pause_. “_Por ahora_.” (for now) _Pause_.\n\n“We can do this the easy way or the hard way. We have Maduro in custody. He’s already in a New York holding facility. He’s being arraigned in federal court tomorrow.\n\n“_Nunca regresará a Venezuela,_” Rubio said. “He’s never coming back to Venezuela.”\n\n“Meanwhile, our oil embargo continues. You can either cooperate with us, or, since you, personally, have already been sanctioned, you may face the same fate, or _worse_. The choice is yours. _Body bags are an undignified way to travel_.”\n\n_Pause._\n\n“I’m listening,” Rodriguez said.\n\n“_Bueno_,” Rubio said. “First, the foreign actors are _desaparecido_ (gone). The Chinese. The Russians. The Iranians. And _especially the Cubans_. We know who they are, where they are, and why they’re there. If they’re not gone in 24 hours, _they’ll be leaving in body bags_. Some already have.\n\n_“Es una promesa, no una amenaza,”_ that’s a promise, not a threat, Rubio emphasized.\n\n“You wouldn’t dare take out the Chinese and the Russians,” Delcy piped in. “That would cause an international incident.”\n\n“Oh, I’ve already spoken to their foreign ministers,” Rubio piped in. “They’ll be gone by sunset, if not sooner. But _you’d better make sure the Cubans are gone_. I know there are plenty of flights from Caracas to Havana today, and _they’d better be on them_. That’s Job One for you, if you give a damn about them.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-FxH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca4c185-cf0c-4ab9-84d8-22c8bc2246f7_600x417.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-FxH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca4c185-cf0c-4ab9-84d8-22c8bc2246f7_600x417.jpeg)\n\n“At least the ones we didn’t kill around Maduro this morning,” Rubio added. “That should teach you a lesson about relying on Cuba. _For anything_.”\n\n“Mr. Secretary,” Rodriguez stepped in, “I’m obligated to protest strongly at what you did. It violated international law and violates our sovereignty.”\n\n“_Perdóneme, señora presidenta,_” spare me, Madam President, “neither you nor that thug we just arrested are legitimate, and most of the world doesn’t recognize you, him, or your government,” Rubio emphasized. “Just the usual suspects in Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and the crooks in Cuba and Nicaragua,” Rubio rattled off. “Not the US, not Canada, not the EU, not Argentina, nor any civilized, democratic nation. You stole an election and you’re deliberately poisoning and killing Americans. Maduro and some of your allies have been under indictment _for a decade_.\n\n“I can have you indicted in a New York minute if that would make you feel more included,” Rubio quipped. “I have your draft indictment on my desk. It makes for interesting reading. And I can guarantee secure, free travel to New York’s Southern District. I can’t promise you’ll enjoy the accommodations, however, but you might find Ghislaine Maxwell an interesting cellmate.\n\n“Can we dispense with your nonsense now and talk next steps, besides what I just mentioned?” Rubio quizzed. “Or, shall I have our warships and CIA do the talking?”\n\nRodriguez realized that her life and career that emerged from Venezuela’s embassy in London 23 years ago, when Hugo Chavez launched his first revolution in 2002, was vanishing before her eyes. She and her mother took over the embassy and earned plaudits from Chavez for staying true, even as his first revolutionary efforts were unsuccessful. Her brother was later rewarded with the vice presidency; she with increasingly higher positions.\n\nSure, it bothered her a little as civil liberties were eliminated under the guise of local “democratic” organizations that eventually were used to monitor and reward citizens, and ration food supplies to loyal, obedient “citizens.” It troubled her _a little_ as industries were nationalized and shortages began to emerge as production of everything from oil to meat began to dwindle, and everything was rationed. American companies were chased out, replaced with Cuban, Russian, Chinese, and then Iranian officials, more interested in looting than helping rebuild Venezuela. The loyal and connected were taken care of. The middle class _vanished_.\n\nIt was socialism on steroids, the “warmth of collectivism,” to quote New York’s new mayor. Anyone who couldn’t afford to leave was left behind; impoverished, and starving.\n\nShe knew not to venture out into neighborhoods. In a country that was once home to 30 million people, some 9 million countrymen and women left, some with encouragement from the Maduro regime. Prisons and mental hospitals were opened, and their occupants shuttled to the border with Colombia for trips to Joe Biden’s open border. She watched with interest as Maduro and his minions manipulated election results to ensure they remained in power.\n\n[![Selected image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1cU-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34525777-ae02-4392-94c8-98d290f0abb2_500x305.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1cU-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34525777-ae02-4392-94c8-98d290f0abb2_500x305.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Maria Machado, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Venezuelan opposition leader and the likely next President, leads a rally.}}\n\nStrange, harsh-looking men from Mexico, mostly from Sinaloa, and others from Colombia and Nicaragua were being shuttled in and out of official government offices. She was excluded from those meetings, but she knew what was going on. They were drug and human traffickers. She was happy to be left out.\n\n“Look, here’s what’s going to happen,” Rubio startled her. “You will cooperate fully with anyone I send. The first person is already in your building, and is outside your office door. You and your team, such as it is, will keep your positions for now as we eradicate the corrupt elements of Maduro’s criminal enterprises, one by one. We need you, but _don’t interfere_. We can replace you if we have to.\n\n“We never made it a secret that last October, [we authorized the CIA to begin operations in your country,](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ex1jq9pdvo)” Rubio said. “You think we were there to enjoy the weather? We had lots of help from members of Operation 2020, which I suspect you’re familiar with,” Rubio said.\n\nRodriguez knew about [Operation 2020](https://theworld.org/stories/2020/02/11/rebels-without-cause-ex-military-struggle-get-colombia), the collection of defectors, many from Maduro’s presidential guard, who escaped to Colombia and elsewhere, some to the United States, with threats to return and overthrow Maduro’s regime. She knew a couple of them, including Yomalf Chavez Lugo.\n\n“You know that Maduro is being held in the same facility as [Hugo Carvajal](https://nypost.com/2026/01/05/us-news/former-venezuela-spy-chief-hugo-carvajal-could-be-star-witness-at-trial-against-nicolas-maduro-experts/), your former intelligence chief,” Rubio said. “He’s an interesting guy. You know him?”\n\n_Pause_.\n\n“We’ve met,” Rodriguez deadpanned. “He’s a traitor. We don’t call him ‘El Pollo’ for nothing.”\n\n[![Former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro being escorted by two officials while a fourth official escorts a woman, likely his wife, Cilia Flores.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vQb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d43c51c-75c3-4ea8-921c-3a234bef1abf_1024x721.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vQb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d43c51c-75c3-4ea8-921c-3a234bef1abf_1024x721.jpeg)\n\n“He may be ‘the chicken’ to you,” Rubio responded, “but he sings like a nightingale.”\n\n“Here’s what else we’re going to do,” Rubio quickly added. “There likely will be elections, sooner than later, after we help repatriate a few million of your countrymen. We will run those elections with _some_ help from the United Nations, or perhaps other European allies with histories of free and fair elections, something that you haven’t had in a while. _And you will honor those elections_.\n\n“In exchange for your cooperation, we will make sure you’re taken care of. But we’ll be watching you like a hawk. Remember, we have eyes _everywhere_. We know where you are, what you’re wearing, where you live, and what you’re likely to be ordering for dinner, and from whom.\n\n“That’s a nice yellow outfit, by the way,” Rubio said. Rodriguez swallowed as she realized she was wearing a yellow pant suit. “That’s a nice color on you.”\n\n_Pause_. “I understand that better than you know, Mr. Secretary.”\n\n“_So we understand each other?_” Rubio asked.\n\n“Yes, Mr. Secretary.”\n\n“You keep coming to your offices. New security officials will visit your offices and introduce themselves. They’ll be friends of _ours_. They will protect you. I know that cooperating with us comes with a price on your head. But the threats will be gone soon. Also, you will be facilitating the return of American energy and other infrastructure experts to help rebuild your country. You will help us ensure their safety. We will help you assert control as long as you cooperate, and we’ll dispose of _anyone_ who gets in the way.\n\n“You’ll sign what you’re asked to sign. No questions asked. And you’ll even get some of the credit.\n\n“Oh, and I’m sure Maria is a fine assistant,” Rubio noted, “and you’re welcome to keep her around. But you’ll have _a new Maria_; she’s arriving in your lobby as I speak. I promise you’ll like her. _She knows a lot about you_. I strongly advise you to trust her and follow her direction. _She will take very good care of you_. And don’t get in her way, either.\n\n“I hope you realize that we’re a little better at security than the Cubans,” Rubio deadpanned. “Just stay out of our way and let us clean things up. It may take a few days, even weeks. But you’ll soon begin to recognize a new Venezuela. And hopefully, you’ll be around to enjoy it.\n\n“Just stay away from the funerals. Think about other countries in the region where you may want to live. May I suggest Panama?”\n\n_Pause._\n\n“Message received and understood, Mr. Secretary. I’m at your service.”\n\n“_Gracias, señora presidenta_. I am a phone call away. The new Maria knows how to get me on the phone right away. I’ll be in touch. And _I look forward to visiting in the very near future_.\n\n“_Viva libre Cuba_.”\n\n_Both hang up._",
