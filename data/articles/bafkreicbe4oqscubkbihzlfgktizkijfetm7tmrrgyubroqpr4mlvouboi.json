Although it might be tempting to dismiss it as just the conservative flavor of doomerism, depopulation could have serious consequences if not addressed. In the U.S., [social security](https://www.economicstrategygroup.org/publication/falling-birth-rates/) depends upon working age adults supporting retirees. That gets far more difficult to do when each generation is smaller than the last. Care workers are already in short supply, and a smaller and smaller pool of people to fill those roles [strains our ability to care for our elders](https://www.albany.edu/news/pdf_files/impact_of_aging_excerpt.pdf). And of course maintaining economic growth is easier to do when your population is increasing rather than decreasing.\n\nGarvey wrote [part one](https://open.substack.com/pub/tamingcomplexity/p/the-geriatric-patriarchys-guide-to?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) of his series on the demographic challenges in Japan. But we aren't the only ones who've been talking about this issue. In fact, there is a whole [pro-natalist movement](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/30/nx-s1-5382208/whats-behind-the-pronatalist-movement-to-boost-the-birth-rate) out there. And the [Republican Party in the U.S.](https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-birth-rates-555c0f78ef8dd4c13c88b9e8d5f0024a) seems to have adopted the crisis as a pet issue. Some, like Elon Musk, even claim that the decline in birthrates is the [biggest danger](https://www.vox.com/policy/363543/pronatalism-vance-birth-rates-population-decline-fertility) humanity has ever faced. It appears wealthy nations are facing a baby apocalypse.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U_QB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d556b9a-4b93-46b6-b107-3eb506dfdab8_989x556.jpeg)  \n*JD Vance giving a speech at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute in 2021 where he makes the argument that parents should have more political rights than non-parents.*\n\nI think one question that hasn't been given substantial enough attention is: so what? What would a population collapse even look like? A collapse doesn't mean an existential threat. What does collapse even entail?\n\nWhen [Joseph Tainter](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Collapse_of_Complex_Societies/YdW5wSPJXIoC?hl=en&gbpv=0) examples civilizational collapse, he notes that collapse is not merely decline. Civilizations can rise and fall without necessarily collapsing. Instead, he defines collapse as a rapid simplification of social structure. For example, when the ancestral Pueblan Chacoan society collapsed, it was not the end of their culture. They continued on in the American Southwest and their direct descendants, the modern day Pueblans, are very much still here. Instead, that collapse took the form of a decentralization of power and reduced cohesion between Chocoan groups that led to more dispersed settlement, ending the construction of great houses and large road networks.\n\n[View image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_yTL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa64d87e7-8908-4f0d-b373-570ea6a91827_894x894.jpeg)\n\nTainter argues that as civilizations become more complex they experience diminishing returns on increasing complexity. Initially specializing, creating and expanding bureaucracies, infrastructure, and technology offer massive benefits. Building roads enables travel, new farming technology increases yields, and centralized state currency eases trade. But each new road is less impactful than the last and requires an ever larger commitment to upkeep. Eventually the upkeep demanded of increasing complexity is greater than the benefit. When this happens, societies either reorganize and simplify strategically, invent some way to reduce the upkeep, or do nothing and simplify very rapidly. The latter is a collapse.\n\nSo a population collapse doesn't have to be a freefall until society can no longer function. It could just mean populations stop growing, or that they reduce slowly to a level that requires less social complexity to manage.\n\nIn fact, insisting that societies keep growing in population without some corresponding social change to reduce complexity could ensure a collapse rather than a managed simplification. Tainter discusses two models describing just such scenarios that led to past societies collapsing instead of rebounding. In what he calls the dinosaur model [lock](https://tamingcomplexity.substack.com/p/apples-and-uber?utm_source=publication-search)-[in](https://tamingcomplexity.substack.com/p/you-cant-go-home-again?utm_source=publication-search) prevents leaders from changing course, instead doubling down on the same old strategies. In the runaway train model, society becomes dependent on the pact of expansion and breaks down when they cannot maintain it. Insisting on maintaining population growth forever and trying to solve it while maintaining old social norms are exactly the sorts of strategies which could ensure that people having fewer babies now actually does lead to a sudden population collapse.\n\n***\n\n*This article reproduces content from Taming Complexity, a substack from a group of political analysts exploring why organizations and societies make bad decisions about science and technology, and how they could make better ones.
