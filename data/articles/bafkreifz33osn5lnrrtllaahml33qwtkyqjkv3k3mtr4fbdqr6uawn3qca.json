  "preview": "For the glory of my family, I give this recipe to The People",
  "body": "_I originally wrote this post for Livejournal in approximately 2009, but the eggnog recipe, itself, has been with my father’s family for generations. I have signers of the Declaration of Independence on both sides of my family tree (in theory — my father’s side is the one I’m more sure of). So I believe this eggnog is a true traditional recipe of my nation._\n\n_Happy holidays!_\n\n_—_\n\nMost people’s experience of eggnog is limited to that horrible store-bought stuff, so most people think they don’t like eggnog. But my family boasts the finest of eggnog recipes, handed down from parent to child over hundreds of years (seriously). My uncle says it’s fine if I tell everyone about it, so I am. Here you go. I think this is the first time it’s ever been in digital form. It’s the best thing ever. Try it. Your life is incomplete until you do (unless you are vegan, which I entirely respect).\n\n**Laurenson Family Eggnog**\n\n_Ingredients:_\n\n2 dozen eggs\n18-24 tablespoons sugar\\[1]\n\n1 quart (or a fifth or 750 ml) rye whiskey (Old Overholt preferred, but any good rye or good bourbon will work)\n\n1 pint cognac\n\n1 half-pint dark rum (Myers preferred, but any good dark rum will work)\n\n1 quart milk\n\n1 quart heavy whipping cream\n\n1 quart light cream or half and half\n\nGround nutmeg\n\nLarge bowl\n\nSmall bowl\n\nMedium bowl\n\nHand mixer\n\n_Steps:_\n\n\\# Separate the eggs (yolks in large bowl, whites in small bowl).\n\n\\# With the hand-mixer on low, mix the sugar into the yolks one tablespoon at a time.\n\n# _**Slowly**_ and in _**small amounts**,_ use the hand-mixer (still on low) to mix the alcohol into the sugary yolks. If you add the alcohol too quickly you will “cook” the yolks and ruin the eggnog, so be careful.\n\n\\# Nod politely as Uncle asserts that Dad is not very masculine and has no idea what true manliness is, viz., sitting in a tree for many hours with a shotgun awaiting the perfect chance to shoot a deer in the head.\n\n\\# In medium bowl, whip the milk products.\n\n\\# Add the milk products slowly to the yolks.\n\n\\# Set the mixer on high. In the small bowl, mix the egg whites until fluffy.\n\n\\# Slowly mix the whites into the large bowl’s contents.\n\n\\# Enjoy the first glass of eggnog, lightly sprinkled with nutmeg. This sample will be sharper and rawer than the eggnog eventually becomes, but it is traditional to sip it and then fervently agree when Uncle pronounces store-bought eggnog to be “sacrilege — a mortal sin.”\n\n\\# Cover eggnog with tinfoil and leave outdoors in the snow overnight. (You may use a refrigerator if you must.)\n\n\\# The next day, haul in the eggnog and mix it up some more. It will have mellowed somewhat, but will not be at its perfect flavor quite yet. Still, it is delicious. In several days — it will be ambrosia.\n\n# Spend several days drunkenly playing vicious bouts of card games and Scrabble. (Note: This recipe is _extremely_ alcoholic, but it’s _also_ very easy to drink, so it will sneak up on you. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.)\n\n•\n\n—\n\n***\n\n\\[1] The original version of this post stated 24. After the publication of this post, my father instructed me to update it to reflect that he has been experimenting with using only 18 tbsp sugar, and that this works well. However, he is adamant that one ought not go below 18.\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
