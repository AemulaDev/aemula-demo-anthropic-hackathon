  "body": "During my nearly quarter century as a food industry lobbyist and communicator, including five years representing the scientific and regulatory wing of the food processing industry, I rarely found myself in agreement with many so-called consumer advocates and industry critics.\n\nOne of them was [Dr. Marion Nestle](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/well/marion-nestle-nutrition-food-profile.html) (no relation to the [giant Swiss food maker](https://www.nestle.com/) best known for making chocolate, ice cream, and pet food), a visiting professor in nutrition at Cornell and a molecular biologist by training. Nestle, in fairness, was one of the more responsible and fair-minded critics and would happily meet with representatives from the food industry to help persuade them to create healthier products or discuss improving food regulation. Nothing wrong with that. Her long-standing blog, [Food Politics](https://www.foodpolitics.com/), is a must-read in the food world. Her posts are concise, to the point, well-documented, and informative.\n\n[!['If you can't pronounce it, don't eat it': Meet the food blogger ...](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J0dK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb253ebf-15f5-4ce3-85ea-4fef409bf302_474x316.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J0dK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb253ebf-15f5-4ce3-85ea-4fef409bf302_474x316.jpeg)\n\n*Vani Hari, “The Food Babe,” an anti-food industry fearmonger and grifter lacking nutritional accreditation, has infiltrated Trump’s official circles. But she’s telegenic, so there’s that.*\n\nMany food industry critics and self-proclaimed consumer advocates are grifters and charlatans, more notable for fear-mongering and spewing often unfounded claims and dubious statistics, as well as flawed studies. Many, like “Food Babe” [Vani Hari](https://www.influencewatch.org/person/vani-hari/), are unaccredited. She blamed her getting appendicitis at age 23 on a bad diet, which is [not how one gets appendicitis](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-appendicitis). Her professional background is computer consulting for Accenture.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s a sucker born every minute (a statement usually falsely attributed to P.T. Barnum) - and the Vani Haris sadly get more attention than the Marion Nestles of the nutrition world. Sometimes they get results and worm their way into other movements, including the “Make America Healthy Again” cause led by Health and Human Services Secretary and former trial lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe Trump Administration has many strengths, but also its share of blind spots. One of them is being attracted to individuals, like moths to a bug zapper, with excellent communication and presentation skills - attractive television celebrities and performers who excel on camera, but often lack expertise or competence.\n\n[![The politics of food with Dr. Marion Nestle – The Rational View podcast ...](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6G1p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45c89121-a222-4c5a-a847-eb5075ed8c6f_474x474.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6G1p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45c89121-a222-4c5a-a847-eb5075ed8c6f_474x474.jpeg)\n\n> So what does she (Nestle) make of [seed oils](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html)? “I really don’t think seed oils are a big deal.”\n>\n> Artificial [food dyes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/well/eat/food-dye-california-ban.html)? “I don’t think it’s the most important issue in the world, but I’d just as soon have them out.”\n>\n> Removing [fluoride](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/well/fluoride-water-health-pregnancy-children.html) from drinking water? “I think water should be fluoridated.

Nestle (pronounced NESS ul) blames the food industry for America’s obesity crisis (it’s unfair and wrongly absolves individuals of their own ignorance, dietary choices, and personal responsibility), and Hari loves scaring people about perfectly safe agriculture practices and food ingredients, including the use of bioengineered (GMOs) foods.\n\nHari infamously went after brominated vegetable oil, an ingredient used in tiny amounts mostly in beverages to prevent them from separating (gum arabic, a natural ingredient found in a swath of trees in central Africa, is another emulsifier that is prevalent in confectionery products). She called brominated vegetable oil a “fire retardant” (duh, so is _water_). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [revoked](https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-revokes-regulation-allowing-use-brominated-vegetable-oil-bvo-food) the regulation permitting its use in 2024, _ten years_ after Pepsi and Coca-Cola removed it from their products.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MhSz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7afd46b-ebdd-4818-8dd3-eabc1699b257_1882x621.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MhSz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7afd46b-ebdd-4818-8dd3-eabc1699b257_1882x621.png)\n\nIt’s just a matter of time before Hari freaks out over _[dihydrogen monoxide](https://www.dhmo.org/facts.html)_ (H20, and if I have to explain to you what that is, you’re a perfect candidate to join the Food Babe Army). Speaking of Hari’s Army, give ‘em credit for knowing how to badger ever-sensitive food makers, who hate controversy and zealously protect their brands, and fold quicker than a beach chair in a hurricane. It is simply a fact that most Americans are profoundly ignorant or have wildly false impressions about what’s in their food. And neither the media, our schools, nor our health infrastructure has done much over the past four decades to correct it.\n\nWhich brings us to both Donald Trump and his recent call with James Quincy, the CEO of his favorite carbonated beverage, Diet Coke, which is made with the artificial zero-calorie sweetener [Aspartame](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2023-aspartame-hazard-and-risk-assessment-results-released), not HFCS or sugar.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zi3l!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e0499d9-ae59-46e8-bb40-bc3451a73dd5_743x267.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zi3l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e0499d9-ae59-46e8-bb40-bc3451a73dd5_743x267.png)\n\nThis is one of those times when Nestle gets it right. The following bullet points are from her blog, even if it was probably painful for her to agree with an industry trade group, the [Corn Refiners Association](https://corn.org/cra-comment-potential-reformulations/):\n\n* HFCS is glucose and fructose separated in liquid form.\n\n* Cane sugar (sucrose) is glucose and fructose bonded, but quickly split (so is beet sugar, but the President is not mentioning it).\n\n* Both HFCS and cane sugar are sugar(s). Both provide about 4 calories per gram.\n\n* There may be people who can taste the difference, but when Coke found that nobody could tell the difference, it switched from sucrose to HFCS.\n\nThere is no nutritional difference between HFCS and sugar, whether from cane or genetically modified sugar beets, which are grown predominantly in the upper Midwest.\n\nHowever, there is a _price difference_. Coke and Pepsi switched from sugar to HFCS decades ago due to cost. The federal government protects domestic sugar growers from competition by imposing strict quotas on imported sugar. The US sugar program, run by the US Department of Agriculture, adjusts those quotas based on industry demand. As a result, sugar costs more in the US than anywhere else in the world.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNQu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb4053c-df19-4b5f-b1bd-3599061cb3bb_1061x1159.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RNQu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fb4053c-df19-4b5f-b1bd-3599061cb3bb_1061x1159.png)\n\nIt is simply a fact that domestic sugar growers can’t produce enough to meet demand, even at high prices. Meanwhile, HFCS is grown exclusively in the United States, especially in the corn belt (including Iowa, America’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, at least for Republicans). So much for “America First.”\n\nThere’s also the reality that sugar growers and their trade group, the [American Sugar Alliance](https://sugaralliance.org/about-us), are politically powerful, particularly the well-connected and influential Fanjul brothers in Florida. [Their political contributions exceed those of every other agricultural industry](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8263jn20zo).\n\nThere is a cult following for colas made from sugar. Both Pepsi and Coca-Cola make them, called “Mexican Coke,” since colas are made with cheap sugar south of the border, particularly for the Hispanic market, but also in areas where kosher-for-passover restricts consumption of grains (sugar isn’t considered a grain, I guess). It also costs more, as sugar is more expensive in the US. Some people swear there’s a difference in taste, but both Coke and Pepsi have tested it with consumers and found that very few people can detect it.\n\nMeanwhile, a 12-ounce cola contains approximately [39 grams of carbs](https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/coca-cola/products/original#accordion-0723f7eecd-item-66ae745cb3), all of which are added sugar, totaling around 150 calories. It’s flavored sugar water, and it’s [contributing to the obesity epidemic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3210834/) in America. “Current estimates are that the mean intake of added sugar by Americans accounts for 15.8% of total energy and that the largest source of these added sugars is nondiet soft drinks, which account for 47% of total added sugars in the diet,” according to [a study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3210834/) published by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt’s also [the top item or category purchased in grocery stores](https://epicforamerica.org/social-programs/here-is-what-food-stamp-recipients-buy/) by lower-income families who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), which you, Mr. and Ms. Taxpayer, subsidize. More than 40 million Americans participate in the program.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dRrO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3923bb5f-ffde-4f59-bc55-8a2d6b37601e_1194x903.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dRrO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3923bb5f-ffde-4f59-bc55-8a2d6b37601e_1194x903.webp)\n\n*These are numbers from 2022. It’s only gotten worse.*\n\nI can’t imagine that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, ex-trial lawyer Kennedy, is all too happy with Trump promoting these beverages, especially as the new [Dietary Guidelines for 2025](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/work-under-way) are about to be released. I assure you that the new Dietary Guidelines won’t be promoting sugar-sweetened beverages, especially the “added sugar” varieties.\n\nThis isn’t the only ingredient in a not-particularly healthy product being pushed by the Trump Administration. Secretary Kennedy has no problem pushing food companies to eradicate or replace seed oils with beef tallow, which some believe produces better-tasting French fries. Never mind that 50 years ago, health advocates, including cardiologists, pressured McDonald’s and others to replace beef tallow with seed oils over [heart disease concerns](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/make-fries-great-again?utm_source=publication-search). Beef tallow is now showing up on grocery store shelves at a very high price point.\n\nI would rather government officials not try to dictate how food companies make their products, especially ones that aren’t known for their health benefits. I’d rather they focus on bringing nutrition education back to schools, including medical schools, where it is rarely taught, and educate children and their parents on how to make healthy eating choices.\n\nThere is so much about the current food debate(s) that mislead people, including tarnishing “ultra-processed foods.” While there are plenty of unhealthy “ultra-processed foods,” that category also snares healthy Greek yogurts. No one seems to agree on a definition. All foods, including sugar-sweetened beverages, can be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet, but in _moderation_. Most Americans have no clue what their nutritional needs are, from protein to fiber and especially calories. [Do you even know what a calorie is?](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/managing-your-weight/understanding-calories/)\n\nAnd nobody wants to talk about how increased alcoholic beverage consumption is playing a role in adult obesity rates. The alcohol industry has resisted efforts to place [nutrition facts labels](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052030/why-your-booze-doesnt-have-a-nutrition-label/) on its products. You can buy wine and beer in most grocery stores. Still, the products are regulated by the ATF—the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms—and not by the Food and Drug Administration or the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nFood makers want to sell products, and they will make whatever consumers want. If you want more protein, food makers, even cereal producers, will make it available. Blaming food makers for their offerings is misguided when consumers are the ones who drive the choices they’re offered. It would be beneficial to see Secretaries Kennedy and Brooke Rollins at USDA (which oversees school feeding programs and SNAP), as well as Linda McMahan at Education, collaborate on a comprehensive nutrition education curriculum for schools, not pushing ingredient changes on food companies, especially beef tallow and cane sugar over HFCS.",
