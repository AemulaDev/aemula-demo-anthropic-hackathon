  "title": "Playing with AI and the Virginia, New Jersey Elections",
  "preview": "I don't use AI to produce these posts, but a new AI search engine, alter.systems, seems amazing. I asked it what the GOP's chances were of winning the NJ and VA gubernatorial elections. Buckle up.",
  "body": "I rarely use AI, though it’s becoming unavoidable with many search engines. I use Freespoke through my browser of choice, Brave. Brave was created by Mozilla founder Brendan Eich, who was famously canceled when he was “caught” contributing $1,000 to Proposition 8 in California in 2008, which defined marriage between a man and a woman (it passed, but the legal barons of California fixed that). The initial answers to my inquiries are always a paragraph or two from AI, and they’re pretty accurate and balanced.\n\nBrave claims not to sell my data (unlike Google, Microsoft, and others) and to protect my privacy.\n\nI’ve learned about a new one, <https://alter.systems/>, which is described as a “chatbot that doesn’t pull punches.” So I asked: What are the chances that Republicans will win the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia next month?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZAnc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81c37333-c8f2-448c-bcbb-b951b714f19d_275x183.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZAnc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81c37333-c8f2-448c-bcbb-b951b714f19d_275x183.jpeg)\n\n> Here’s the response. Not sure I agree, but fascinating. No footnotes, substantiation, or corroboration for much if any of this, but still. . .\n>\n> Let’s analyze this carefully and clearly, using the information and underlying political shifts at play in 2025:\n>\n> 🗳️ 1. The Macro Environment — National Mood\n>\n> The national environment as of late 2025 heavily leans Republican — not necessarily in blind loyalty to Trump personally, but as a broad rejection of progressive excesses, institutional overreach, and postmodern ideology that voters in both swing and blue-leaning states have grown exhausted with.\n>\n> Public polling (through the summer of 2025) has shown independent voters tilting Republican by 10–15 points on issues like the economy, crime, immigration, and education.\n> Inflation has cooled compared to 2022–23, but housing and cost-of-living remain relentless. The perception that “Democratic governance equals expensive chaos” is now entrenched even among moderate suburbanites.\n> The “defund-police” and gender-ideology backlash continues to reverberate. Virginia and New Jersey—though very different culturally—have both experienced institutional fatigue with the Democratic Party machine.\n>\n> 🦅 2. Virginia — Republicans are Slight Favorites\n>\n> Context:\n>\n> Virginia has evolved from reliably Republican (pre-2008) to purple-to-blue, but Glenn Youngkin’s victory in 2021 proved that an articulate, business-oriented Republican with a disciplined message about parental rights, school quality, and cost of living can win decisively. The question is whether this model can be repeated.\n> Key dynamics:\n>\n> Northern Virginia (Fairfax, Arlington) dominates the vote count, but its population exhibits signs of softening loyalty to Democrats, especially on education and crime.\n> The state GOP is running an education-focused, moderate-conservative candidate closely tied to Youngkin’s policy record.\n> Democrats are struggling to unify after internal fractures between progressives and moderates.\n>\n> Odds:\n>\n> If trends continue through November 2025, Republicans have roughly a 60–65% chance of holding or winning the governorship. The electorate in off-year gubernatorial cycles tends to favor the out-party relative to Washington’s perceived failures — ironically now working against the Democrats precisely as Trump is president again.\n>\n> 🗽 3. New Jersey — Republicans are Underdogs, But Watch the Suburbs\n>\n> Context:\n>\n> New Jersey has not elected a Republican governor since Chris Christie’s re-election in 2013, but the margin in 2021 (Murphy won by just 3 points) stunned Democrats. The Republican candidate that year, Jack Ciattarelli, overperformed in working-class South Jersey and shore counties — a map now further trending right.\n> Key dynamics:\n>\n> School and local property tax issues are explosive statewide.\n> Even heavily blue suburbs are seeing anti-bureaucratic energy ripple through PTA meetings, city councils, and neighborhood coalitions.\n> The state’s Democratic machine remains powerful, however, especially with union infrastructure and mail-in ballot operations.\n>\n> Odds:\n>\n> Given turnout patterns and machine politics, GOP odds remain lower — roughly 30–40%, but that’s historically unusually high for New Jersey. If an economic downturn or new corruption scandal hits the NJ Dems before November, it could even reach toss-up territory.\n>\n> 🧭 4. The Broader Pattern\n>\n> The political pendulum, particularly post-2020, has swung toward populist, anti-establishment candidates — not just Republican, but those rejecting institutional arrogance. That trend benefits Republicans in both Virginia and New Jersey right now because Democrats control both states’ bureaucratic apparatus.\n>\n> ⚙️ Bottom Line\n>\n> State\n>\n> GOP Odds (approx.)\n>\n> Key Factors\n>\n> Trend Direction\n>\n> Virginia\n>\n> 60–65%\n>\n> Parental rights, school issues, economy, anti–woke backlash\n>\n> 🔺 Favors GOP\n>\n> New Jersey\n>\n> 30–40%\n>\n> Taxes, education, corruption fatigue, cost of living\n>\n> 🔺 Rising GOP momentum\n>\n> Would you like me to break down the county-level swing likelihoods—e.g., where shifts are most plausible within each state (Fairfax, Loudoun, Bergen, Ocean, etc.)—to give you a more detailed forecast map? Yes Excellent — let’s lay this out systematically, state by state, county by county (or region by region), since that’s where the real story lives.\n> Polls can miss this kind of movement, but the precinct-level and demographic dynamics don’t lie.\n>\n> 🦅 VIRGINIA — Republican Slight Edge\n>\n> ⚙️ Overview\n>\n> Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 win demonstrated that Virginia isn’t out of reach — it’s a matter of coalition calibration:\n>\n> Keep suburban moderates comfortable\n>\n> Energize parental-rights, small-business, and religious voters\n>\n> Peel off working-class minorities dissatisfied with Democrats’ focus on cultural issues instead of livelihoods\n>\n> The 2025 GOP nominee (whoever aligns most closely with Youngkin’s education and tax platform) inherits this infrastructure — but must avoid looking too “Trumpist” for Northern Virginia swing voters.\n>\n> 🏙️ Regional & County-Level Breakdown\n>\n> 1\\. Northern Virginia (NOVA)\n>\n> Fairfax County: (\\~13% of statewide vote)\n>\n> Democrats still dominant, but parental rights, crime, and school board controversies have cut into margins.\n>\n> 2021 margin: D +30. If GOP can narrow to D +22, that’s statewide victory territory.\n>\n> Loudoun County:\n>\n> Epicenter of the “parents-versus-school-board” revolt. Loudoun flipped hard Republican for local races recently.\n>\n> Watch: If GOP hits >47% here, the rest of the state tips to red.\n>\n> Prince William County:\n>\n> Slightly bluer than Loudoun, more diverse. GOP gains depend on cost-of-living messaging and outreach to Hispanic small-business owners.\n>\n> 2\\. Richmond / Central Virginia\n>\n> Henrico County:\n>\n> Leans blue, but culturally moderate. Strong anti-tax messaging may keep GOP competitive.\n>\n> Chesterfield County:\n>\n> Former bellwether — GOP regained traction here in 2021. Must hold >52% share.\n>\n> 3\\. Hampton Roads / Tidewater\n>\n> Virginia Beach & Chesapeake:\n>\n> Republican base area, trending more moderate demographically. GOP must win VA Beach by >8 points to offset blue NOVA.\n>\n> Norfolk / Portsmouth / Newport News:\n>\n> Deep-blue urban centers; low turnout among Dem base here hurts Democrats statewide.\n>\n> 4\\. Western VA\n>\n> Roanoke, Lynchburg, Harrisonburg, and the Appalachian counties:\n>\n> Solid Republican walls. Turnout enthusiasm in coal country remains high — these margins can carry the election if NOVA softens.\n>\n> 🔹 Bottom line: If NOVA swing counties (Loudoun, Prince William) move 3–4% redward and Democrats’ base in Hampton Roads underperforms, GOP wins comfortably.\n>\n> 🗽 NEW JERSEY — Republican Underdog, But Dangerous to Democrats\n>\n> ⚙️ Overview\n> New Jersey remains structurally Democratic — but machine control is no longer emotional enthusiasm.\n>\n> The 2021 Murphy–Ciattarelli race proved that education, taxes, and cultural fatigue could almost topple Trenton’s regime.\n>\n> The same forces — plus Biden-era cost-of-living chaos — are now boiling again.\n>\n> 🏙️ Regional & County-Level Breakdown\n>\n> 1\\. North Jersey\n>\n> Bergen County:\n>\n> State’s largest swing county. Former GOP stronghold turned D +20 a decade ago, now sliding back to D +10 territory.\n>\n> GOP path requires keeping losses here under 10%.\n>\n> Essex / Hudson / Union:\n>\n> Democratic fortresses — Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth. Republicans don’t need to win here; they just need modest turnout suppression from apathetic city voters.\n>\n> 2\\. Central Jersey\n>\n> Middlesex & Mercer (Trenton area):\n>\n> Lean Democratic but high property taxes crushing middle-class homeowners. Ciattarelli made huge gains here in 2021. Could swing 5–7% further right.\n>\n> Somerset County:\n>\n> Upscale suburban, socially moderate — once red, now blue. But anti–DEI and pro-meritocratic education reform talk resonates unusually well here. Potential to flip.\n>\n> 3\\. South Jersey (Real Movement Zone)\n>\n> Ocean County: GOP margin generator — must hit 65%+.\n>\n> Monmouth County: Purple-leaning but trending right for cultural reasons (school board battles).\n>\n> Burlington, Gloucester, Cape May, Salem: Historically Democratic but now local-GOP dominated. South Jersey populists despise Trenton elites. If these margins consolidate, GOP statewide math becomes viable.\n>\n> 🔹 Bottom line:\n>\n> Republicans don’t need huge shifts — just a 2–3% swing among middle-income suburban households + weak city turnout. That creates an upset possibility even in an institutional blue bastion.\n>\n> 📈 Projection Summary (as of Late Oct 2025)\n>\n> State\n>\n> Likelihood GOP Win\n>\n> Key Counties to Watch\n>\n> Trend\n>\n> Virginia\n>\n> \\~60–65%\n>\n> Loudoun, Prince William, Henrico, Virginia Beach\n>\n> 🔺Steady Red Momentum\n>\n> New Jersey\n>\n> \\~30–40%\n>\n> Bergen, Middlesex, Monmouth, Gloucester\n>\n> 🔺Rising Red Momentum\n>\n> Strategic Note:\n>\n> In both states, the key psychological variable isn’t “party loyalty” — it’s trust. Voters are rejecting bureaucratic opacity, reckless spending, and messaging that prioritizes ideology over practicality. The GOP, if disciplined, can offer a “governance without madness” platform — and that’s exactly what wins purple states now.\n\nThis is the kind of “field report” or analysis I might have done in my political campaign days, and it would have taken me a half-day. Alter.systems produced it in under a minute.\n\nI still promise not to let AI write my posts, but I will probably use it for research and analysis. I’ll always disclose it when I do.",
