  "body": "_“Of about half of all Americans who make New Year’s resolutions on January 1,_ _**[22 percent](https://share.google/OeSulH5JlkRVIyGxY)**_ _have failed at the end of week one; 50 percent at three months; and 81 percent after two years. Knowing this, you might conclude that New Year’s resolutions are stupid. That would be a mistake. Resolutions are very good, in fact: They are a sign that you want to improve your life in tangible ways, which is healthy and positive. People need something in their lives that’s worth striving for. You just have to be smart about how to make your resolutions.”_\n\nArthur Brooks, writing for _[The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/arthur-brooks-the-problem-with-your-new-years-resolution?r=2jzfq\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web)_\n\nI feel exonerated by the estimable Arthur Brooks, a brilliant author and former President of the equally estimable American Enterprise Institute.\n\nBelatedly, this is the fourth and final installment on my resolutions - for me, thee, and now, officials in state capitals and Washington. I’m off to a good start on my own resolutions - and one of my predictions for 2026 has already come true (Maduro’s fall). And it looks like one of my 2025 predictions, the fall of Iran’s tyrannical Shiite regime, might just be a few days/weeks late. However, Maduro’s “fall” wasn’t accompanied by “regime change.” Most of the bad people in charge of that broken country are still in charge, but I get what the Trump Administration is trying to do. They seem to have learned lessons from the errors made after Saddam Hussein’s Iraq fell. I’ll be patient.\n\n[![Law enforcement officials move captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, second from left, out of the helicopter in New York on January 5.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHK3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6aa473-8e92-4d46-97c3-be05e3d44922_500x281.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tHK3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6aa473-8e92-4d46-97c3-be05e3d44922_500x281.jpeg)\n\nNot much happens legislatively, at the federal or state level, in most election years, so predictions should be easy: _nothing significant will happen_. Usually, lots happen just _after_ election years, especially when a political party has solid control over the levels of power, as we’re about to see in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, Democratic majoritarians are salivating over billions in new spending for paid family leave and imposing Cannabis retail outlets everywhere, with licenses owned by ex-convicts. [I kid you not](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/12/03/by-this-time-next-year-virginia-likely-will-have-legal-weed-sales-heres-how-they-might-work/). And they’re just getting started.\n\nVoters in both states are about to get what they voted for, good and hard, just like they did when the disastrous Obamacare (“Affordable Care Act”) was signed into law almost exactly 15 years ago. “Defenders” of Obamacare, such as they are, can only point to one achievement - reducing the number of uninsured, but almost entirely based on a massive expansion of Medicaid spending that is a principal driver of the public debt, and, as we’re learning, [rife with corruption](https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2025/medicaid-fraud-control-units-annual-report-fiscal-year-2024/), and that’s before we start counting the [Minnesota Somali-Democratic scandal](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/12/18/minnesota-fraud-new-charges-medicaid-scam).\n\n[![Thompson delivers a statement](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-gCN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83a98e27-aef1-4cea-9f6d-8315cad39cd0_600x400.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-gCN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83a98e27-aef1-4cea-9f6d-8315cad39cd0_600x400.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson (center) of Minnesota delivers remarks as a slide reading “$18 billion” is displayed during a news conference about alleged fraud against the government at the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Kerem Yücel | MPR News}}\n\nAnd forget about Congress doing much of anything in an election year when partisan control is up for grabs, especially in the US House. Democratic leaders will pressure their troops not to cooperate with Republicans, and by and large, they won’t, especially in the US Senate.\n\n**Resolution #1: Manage Expectations - Focus on Budget,** **[Reconciliation](https://www.westernjournal.com/john-kennedy-drops-knees-begs-thune-another-reconciliation-bill/), and Appropriations**\n\nIf history is any guide, Republicans are in their last year of complete “control” of Congress, if you can call it that. While Senate Republicans hold a majority (3 seats, 4 if you include the Vice President’s ability to break ties) that is currently larger than the one House Republicans enjoy.\n\nThe latest resignation (Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-GA) has taken effect, and the sudden passing of US Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), a favorite of California’s food and agriculture communities, has further dwindled the GOP’s House “majority” to two seats out of 435 Members. That’s not “control” when you have uncompromising factions such as the House Freedom Caucus, renegades like US Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and the handful of more moderate Republicans sitting in marginal seats, such as freshman Rob Bresnahan (R-PA) and especially Mike Lawler (R?-NY) who joined Democrats to vote to extend “temporary” Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies to 8-10 million middle-class and upper-middle class Americans.\n\nWhen you only have a 2-5 seat margin, especially in the House, it just takes a couple of malcontents in your party to screw things up. The same is true in the Senate at the committee level, where the GOP has in most cases a one-seat margin. It just takes one Tom Tillis (R-NC) to decide who the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve will be, or not. The Trump Administration has been [forced to withdraw a record-setting 57 nominees](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-nominees-withdrawn-senate-republicans-b2875853.html) as of December 1. Many of them were withdrawn at the objection of a single GOP senator or two on a committee.\n\nSo-called “hardliners” among the GOP need to get over themselves and compromise on appropriations and reconciliation (especially the former). The fact is that Democratic votes are needed. Get what you can and call it a win, but get the job done, because the result will be another government shutdown or two and big omnibus pork-filled appropriations bills that will be even worse.\n\n**Resolution #2:** **Mitigate Toxic Polarization**\n\nBut there is one thing our leaders, mostly in Congress and the White House but elsewhere, could commit to doing, if they’re willing and able: take steps to mitigate _toxic_ polarization. Not all “polarization” is bad. Some conflict is necessary and good. And they can’t _eliminate all toxicity_; that is impossible, but they can start by dismantling the rewards system, the deep divisions, and the excessive politicization that poisoned Congress’s ability to address any of our significant problems.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ywNe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71341c41-c922-42e5-9e18-a5181eeb27c1_1100x738.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ywNe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71341c41-c922-42e5-9e18-a5181eeb27c1_1100x738.png)\n\nMuch of our toxic polarization has been fed to a willing media by malevolent foreign actors. But Trump Derangement Syndrome\\*\\*™,\\*\\* coupled with fear of primary election challenges by otherwise sensible Democratic incumbents, has made bipartisanship a thing of the past. Republicans have a similar problem with their MAGA base that will tolerate no opposition to the President’s pronouncements. In both cases, the major political parties have allowed their tails to wag the dogs. And the relentless march towards partisan mid-term redistricting of US House seats is institutionalizing the problem for a generation, or at least until 2031.\n\nThis might even be impossible with our current cast of political leaders, especially on the Democratic side, who covet power above all else and smell blood in the upcoming election. But all journeys begin with the first step.\n\nHow to do it? I don’t have an easy answer. But it doesn’t start with the leadership, since they’ve always been part of the problem. I remember well a conversation with the late US Rep. John Adler (D-NJ), one of the few Democrats I’ve supported politically who served one term (2009-2010) before losing in a GOP wave and then tragically and suddenly passing away shortly after his reelection defeat.\n\nAdler, a former state senator, was elected the same year as a former GOP state senate colleague (and floor leader), Leonard Lance (R-NJ). They both pledged to ignore their leaders and work together on a bipartisan basis. Both quickly learned that their leadership strongly forbade it and would practically threaten to punish them if they did. Lance no longer serves in Congress (his seat is now held by US Rep. Tom Kean Jr., R-NJ).\n\nThis is where the “Problem Solvers” Caucus steps in. It’s not perfect, but it features members such as Tom Suozzi (D-NY) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) who are at least willing to work together towards bipartisan solutions to real problems. If the Congress stays bitterly divided as I expect it to after the 2026 elections, no matter who wins control, they could, if they’re smart, emerge as the power brokers in the new 119th Congress.\n\nThey’ll have to step up their game at risk to their personal political fortunes. Many of these members, including Fitzpatrick and Suozzi, represent marginal districts. Stepping up and being a leader, taking risks on the big issues of the day, from the integrity of our national elections to addressing our national debt and saving Social Security and Medicare, will require courage. Do any of them have it? We’ll find out. I’m not optimistic, but polling indicates that Americans are very hungry for it.\n\n[![Bipartisan Congressional Retreat](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-S4O!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F814c73a4-bbb8-433c-a96f-9c2d467c560c_768x510.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-S4O!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F814c73a4-bbb8-433c-a96f-9c2d467c560c_768x510.jpeg)\n\nBut as a start, I encourage them to pick up the mantle of former US Rep. and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood (R-IL) to find ways to improve the culture on Capitol Hill. LaHood used to spearhead bipartisan retreats for Members of Congress and their families to help build relationships and reduce toxicity. It worked briefly, but with his and others’ departures, no one has picked up his chalice. It’s still lying there. Maybe bipartisan retreats in Hershey, PA, are not the answer. But the “Problem Solvers” caucus should start with the big problem of Congress’s toxic culture, where nothing can get done. A bipartisan special committee on the “[modernization](https://cha.house.gov/select-committee-on-the-modernization-of-congress-116th-117th-congress)” of Congress made progress, but its co-chairs have left Congress as well (except for Rep. Bill Timmons, R-SC), and its focus was more on improving internal operations than fostering a more effective _culture_.\n\nAnd that’s part of the problem; voluntary departures from Congress are at a historic high.\n\n[![Selected image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YxwR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59515ef5-fdd3-46af-a5d9-b2fe708e190e_500x270.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YxwR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59515ef5-fdd3-46af-a5d9-b2fe708e190e_500x270.png)\n\n**Resolution #3: Restore Integrity in our Elections**\n\nI can think of many pressing issues I’d like Congress to address. Our exploding federal deficit and debt, in my humble opinion, ought to be Job One. And that starts with Job Two - reforming Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, the biggest drivers of that debt, and the first two of which are racing towards bankruptcy and are poised for terribly disruptive benefit cuts within the decade.\n\nJob Three ought to be taking on that long-standing bugaboo of waste, fraud, and abuse, which we are now learning teems through a number of federal programs, from Medicaid (especially) to nutrition assistance programs. [But that seems to be underway](https://shipwreckedcrew.substack.com/p/yes-the-trumpbondi-doj-is-aggressively), and I hope it intensifies. I also hope that states cooperate, but I’m not hopeful, since many governors and attorneys general, among others, have been asleep at the switch, if not complicit. [Especially in Minnesota](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/02/database-searches-show-somali-fraudsters-funding-democrat-politicians/).\n\nA criminal enterprise is unfolding before our eyes, and it involves more than the Democratic Party. It works like this: Progressive non-government organizations help elect Democratic politicians. Those politicians throw tax money at them. They use those dollars to help enrich themselves and their comrades, and elect the politicians who fund them. We are seeing that in spades from the highly inflationary “Inflation Reduction Act” and other massive spending bills enacted during the Biden Administration under a Democratic-controlled Congress. This is worth a series of posts on its own, and I might just undertake to write it. The evidence is accumulating, and that’s barely the half of it. Democrats, of course, will accuse Republicans of doing the same thing with defense spending.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, citing studies from the General Accountability Office (GAO, an arm of Congress), alarmingly claims that up to 10 percent of our $6-7 trillion in federal spending is “[stolen](https://nypost.com/2026/01/12/us-news/treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-reveals-up-to-10-of-us-budget-stolen-each-year/?utm_medium=social\\&utm_campaign=nypost\\&utm_sf_post_ref=650541413\\&utm_sf_cserv_ref=17469289\\&utm_source=twitter).” His words, not mine. But I suspect that may be a conservative estimate, if Minnesota and California are any indication.\n\nSpeaking of criminal enterprises, there is no more important thing that Congress and the states can do than restore integrity to our elections. _At all levels_.\n\nI’m reading a book that will be the subject of a future post: _[Stolen Elections, The Takedown of Democracies Worldwide](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=stolen+elections+the+takedown+of+democracies+worldwide\\&crid=3PQGY392DTR4W\\&sprefix=Stolen%2Caps%2C218\\&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-expert-pd-ops-ranker_2_6),_ by Ralph Pelluzzo. I’ve written earlier about the need for all of us to be open to changing our minds in light of new evidence. I’ve always thought claims of the “theft” of the 2020 and, to a lesser extent, the 2022 elections were overwrought and unproven. Courts never quite concluded that, but denied hearings over a lack of “standing,” or a basis to challenge the results. _This book is changing my mind_, but I’ll write about that later. I invite you to read it in the meantime. The book was published last September, but it has taken me this long to discover it.\n\n[![Stolen Elections: The Takedown Of Democracies Worldwide](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U6nR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc51dfbd0-40f1-4176-b484-807d536a8a57_311x466.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U6nR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc51dfbd0-40f1-4176-b484-807d536a8a57_311x466.jpeg)\n\nThere is little doubt that many Americans have lost confidence in the integrity of our elections. It started with the horrendous “hanging chad” debacle in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. But it’s only grown over time, with Democrats challenging George W. Bush’s 2004 reelection and, of course, Hillary Clinton claiming that Donald Trump “stole” the 2016 election. Trump repeated the favor in 2020 when Biden “won” a record 81 million votes, with some very surprising outcomes in states like Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. Even in 2024, but not to the same degree.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5heL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e5fee69-143b-4fe3-82d2-a3f2d8baa2cd_1024x813.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5heL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e5fee69-143b-4fe3-82d2-a3f2d8baa2cd_1024x813.png)\n\n{{caption:Source: Center for Election Integrity and Research, a survey of GOP and Trump voters. Democrats felt different then, but less so in 2016 and 2024. Many voters have replaced acceptance of election results with blaming election systems and administrators for their results.}}\n\nThere’s no question that elections have changed dramatically, certainly since I cast my first votes on a paper ballot in the basement of the First Baptist Church in Washington, Oklahoma, in 1974. There was no “absentee voting” then. There was no “voting by mail.” There was no such thing as early voting. The polls closed, and the ballots were counted that night, and we knew the winner in most cases before we went to bed.\n\nA quarter century later, other things emerged like punch cards and voting by electronic devices, including those big, boxy voting machines with curtains behind which you could flip levers of the candidates of your choice. They often broke down, often on purpose, creating chaos, and judges extended voting hours so campaigns could bus “supporters” to those polls.\n\nWere those old voting systems perfect? Of course not. Paper ballots could be miscounted, spoiled, and “misplaced,” and ballot boxes “stuffed” by malevolent partisan election clerks after the polls closed, on behalf of voters who never showed. That still reportedly happens in places like Philadelphia. How does that work? Democratic election officials chase GOP poll workers out of the precinct. Those GOP workers complain to lawyers, who run to local judges. The judges, after several hours, order the reinstatement of the poll workers, but by then, the damage is done.\n\nThe failure of states and localities to keep updated - _clean_ - voter rolls has always been a problem, even after enactment of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (“Motor Voter”). It’s why we get reports of voters casting ballots from the grave and sometimes across state lines.\n\nIt’s very, very hard and expensive to track down, much less prove, voter “irregularities,” certain enough in time between an election and swearing-in day to swing the outcome. Meanwhile, there are legitimate issues with making it easier for people who travel to vote, are serving or living overseas, or have other issues that make it challenging to show up in person on election day. There needs to be a well-monitored balance.\n\nBut that balance was violated in a big way during the pandemic. State laws were literally tossed or rewritten not by legislatures, but by election officials and judges, especially in Pennsylvania. Virginia Democrats extended “early voting” for 45 days. Many states, including Virginia, dramatically expanded “elected day registration,” although it’s nearly impossible for officials to verify the veracity of those “new” voters.\n\nMinnesota expanded its long-standing election-day registration scheme to [allow one person to “vouch” for up to 8 other people](https://wltreport.com/2025/12/27/breaking-minnesota-allows-voters-vouch-up-eight-other/) who showed up to vote without identification. That’s still the law.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dEw8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb2d4f8c-2f66-4915-814b-419903795b29_710x407.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dEw8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb2d4f8c-2f66-4915-814b-419903795b29_710x407.jpeg)\n\nOther states, including North Carolina, allowed ballots to arrive days after the election, so long as they were “postmarked” by election day (and mail is sometimes not postmarked, or [the postmark is affixed on a following day](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/statements/010226-postmarking-myths-and-facts.htm?_wcsid=7BF5F3F06E0F7EF8E7ADA697D5F588D22669F00B7081D5F5)). “Drop boxes,” many of the unmonitored, were introduced. “Ballot harvesting,” the ability of individuals and organizations to distribute and/or collect ballots from individuals and return them on their behalf were institutionalized in some states, including California (it is still illegal in many others).\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5ebY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7ec96ff-586d-4ea7-8666-d90ad09442f6_1280x853.avif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5ebY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7ec96ff-586d-4ea7-8666-d90ad09442f6_1280x853.avif)\n\nAnd now, concerns have arisen over the ability of malevolent foreign actors to manipulate electronic voting machines that aren’t supposed to be connected to the internet, but are in reality connected at least once or twice. Or, as they “break down,” as happens frequently in Maricopa County, Arizona, to have “cards” in the machines replaced that contain source codes that allow results to be manipulated.\n\nIt only needs to happen in a few counties or precincts. Not everywhere. Just enough to shave enough votes off the results to get the winner you want. It has now been documented in the aforementioned book, with the help of whistleblowers from inside the companies, that these machines have been peddled to state officials in places like Georgia and Arizona, and in dozens of other states and countries.\n\nThese changes have stressed election officials and resources, making it much easier for mistakes and fraud to occur. Integrity needs to be restored without unfairly erecting barriers to citizens casting legitimate votes before election day ends. My wish list includes this from Congress and the states in time for the elections this fall.\n\n**Mandate photo ID**, an official government identification that most eligible voters have and can obtain easily, even if they don’t drive. Some states offer official IDs for free. Congress should enact the SAVE Act to achieve that.\n\n**Reform absentee and early voting**. Mail voting is out of control. We’ve gone from Election Day to Election Season, especially with some states allowing early voting 45 days in advance. That’s ludicrous. Two weeks of early, in-person voting should be enough, and voters should be required to request an absentee ballot, not have one just show up at their mailbox or residence.\n\n**Suspend voting by machine**. There is now credible evidence that voting machines cannot be trusted. We need a temporary, if not permanent, return to paper balloting. Some states, like Virginia and parts of Pennsylvania, use paper ballots that are scanned for counting. That might work so long as they are not connected to the internet in any way, and paper records of the results are produced. Canada gets by just fine with paper-only ballots for their federal elections.\n\nKudos to the Department of Justice for finally getting serious about enforcing the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act to **force states to clean up their voter rolls**. At a minimum, states should run their voter rolls up against the Social Security files (death records) and the newly expanded Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system. Some people find this controversial, even “Orwellian.” While it’s possible for the system to have errors (what system doesn’t?), I applaud it for verifying voter eligibility. What I find “Orwellian” are arguments against it.\n\nBesides, there are dozens of data brokers that have thousands of data points on you that they sell to anyone willing to pay their price. _Why do you think you’re spammed with so many emails and texts_?\n\nLastly, let’s **audit both major parties’ online political contribution systems**, ActBlue and WinRed. ActBlue is already under the gun for the sloppiness of its record-keeping, not even requiring the credit card verification numbers on the back of credit cards. ActBlue even allowed gift cards to be used for making political contributions. Now that we know that election devices can be manipulated, how difficult do you think it is for small amounts of money to be flooded into our election system from nefarious sources? One version of this is called “Smurfing,” and the Department of Justice, along with the Department of the Treasury, needs to fully audit and investigate.\n\nWe need to keep foreign and illegal sources of funding away from our elections. Maybe it’s not a big problem, but there doesn’t seem to be any accountability. It’s long overdue.\n\nThere’s a lot more on my wish list, and probably yours. But this post is already too long. I’d like a BRAC-like commission to devise fixes to entitlement programs like Social Security, and perhaps look at reorganizing the federal government, perhaps through a revised “DOGE”-like program that includes more engagement from former officials and even Congress to identify programs and agencies that need to be eliminated, merged, updated, or reformed.\n\nBut it’s an election year, and we need to keep our expectations in check. Just do what you have to, Congress, fix your toxic culture, and make sure we have elections in 2026 in which we can be confident in the results (add 2028 while you're at it).\n\nIs that asking too much?\n\nProbably.",
