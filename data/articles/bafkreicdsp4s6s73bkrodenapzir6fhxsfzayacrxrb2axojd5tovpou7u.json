I have been guilty of thinking the sterile environment of an office doesn’t exactly lead to impressive creativity or much empathy.\n\nHowever, the powers that be at Proctor & Gamble proved me wrong with their new advertising campaign for the world’s tiniest diaper.\n\nThe commercial, especially the scripted voice-over, left me on my couch in a puddle of tears.\n\nIt showed an extra small diaper created just for a micro-preemie. As a former NICU mom, I remember seeing babies whose tiny bodies couldn’t fit in the diapers.\n\nMy twins were born at 32 weeks in early 2021 as COVID ravaged the world and spent five and seven weeks in the NICU.\n\nIt is a unique and traumatic experience to have babies who need to spend a long stretch in the hospital before they can come home to their families.\n\nIn a short commercial, Pampers managed to show all the fear and hope that exists in the tiny fighters in the NICU and their families.\n\nThat’s the power of great storytelling within a company.\n\nHow are you using storytelling in your professional life today?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LxxO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8da8f788-95c9-4fa1-8910-eabb15302083_612x411.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LxxO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8da8f788-95c9-4fa1-8910-eabb15302083_612x411.jpeg)",
