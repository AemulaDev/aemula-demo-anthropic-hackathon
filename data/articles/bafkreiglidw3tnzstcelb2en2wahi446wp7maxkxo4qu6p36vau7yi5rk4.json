  "body": "_**Irony: when events or words are the opposite of what is expected, creating a sense of surprise, humor, or deeper meaning in literature, rhetoric, and everyday situations. —**_ _**[Scribbr.com](https://www.scribbr.com/rhetoric/irony/)**_\n\nPerhaps you heard the news. Democrats in the Texas legislature left the state over the weekend to avoid providing a quorum for a special session to enact a new map of congressional districts. That map is designed to increase the number of Republican representatives in Congress by five. They were supposed to go in session at 3 p.m. yesterday, as I write this.\n\nOf course, it’s a partisan power grab by Republicans, designed to try to protect their razor-thin majority in advance of the 2026 mid-term elections. It may or may not work - as [we shared the other day](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/political-arms-race-gerrymandering), Republicans are banking on a trend of Hispanic voters shifting to the GOP over the past decade, especially with Donald Trump on the ballot. Democrats are within their rights to be upset, oppose, and challenge the redistricting in the legislature, where they will almost certainly lose. And the prospects for a successful court challenge aren’t much better. The GOP has heavy majorities in the state House (88-62) and Senate (19-12), having slightly increased their margins in the 2024 elections.\n\nTexas law requires two-thirds of legislators for a quorum to enact legislation. They’re only in session once every two years, unless the Governor, Greg Abbott, calls them into special session, which he has. And not for the first time in recent years, Democrats have fled the state to prevent the quorum Republicans need to enact their new map. Other state legislators have behaved similarly, including in 2011 when Wisconsin Democrats fled to Rockford, Illinois. Texas Democrats have done this more than once before.\n\n[![JB Pritzker on Twitter: \"Great to be back at the State Fair celebrating ...](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nXC2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92ba46f2-ae75-402e-9f60-4d13a60a48e0_474x318.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nXC2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92ba46f2-ae75-402e-9f60-4d13a60a48e0_474x318.jpeg)\n\n*Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL)*\n\nBut they didn’t just flee to neighboring Oklahoma, which they did just four years ago. They fled into the open arms of Illinois Governor, likely 2028 presidential aspirant, billionaire Hilton Hotel heir, and Democrat J. B. Pritzker. Pritzker recently made news with calls for mass protests, which some interpret as [inciting violence](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/04/28/white-house-chief-of-staff-says-pritzkers-call-for-mass-protests-could-be-construed-as-inciting-violence), in opposition to Donald Trump and Republicans. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,” Pritzker said, stressing the party “must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”\n\nTexas Democrats just didn’t flee into the welcoming arms of Gov. Pritzker. They dove headfirst into a deep sea of irony. If you’re going to complain about partisan redistricting, maybe don’t run to a state that’s one of the most recent and egregious examples of it, and by _your political party._\n\n[![undefined](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C28G!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c529a49-daa9-474a-9056-1f93ff6e8d14_800x800.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C28G!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c529a49-daa9-474a-9056-1f93ff6e8d14_800x800.png)\n\n*The current map of 17 US House districts in Illinois from the 2020 Census. Illinois, due to a population decline, lost a seat from the prior Census. These lines are very creative and are designed to shove as many Republican voters into as few districts as possible.*\n\nRepublicans currently hold just _three_ of Illinois’s 17 congressional seats, or less than _18 percent_. They include US Representatives Darin LaHood, Mary Miller, and Mike Bost of Southern Illinois. But in 2024, Republican congressional candidates won _47 percent_ of the statewide vote. Pritzker and his allies in the heavily Democratic-controlled legislature eliminated as many GOP seats as they could, including one held by US Rep. Adam Kinzinger, despite his being a rabid never-Trumper and [useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot) for Democrats on the infamous and allegedly [corrupt](https://cha.house.gov/2024/12/chairman-loudermilk-releases-second-january-6-2021-report) Select House Committee on the events of January 6, 2021. Kinzinger was personally chosen to serve on that Committee, along with former Rep. Lynn Cheney (R-WY), by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) after she arrogantly violated protocol and rejected a slate of Republicans chosen by then-GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nPritzker found a funny way to thank Kinzinger for his service. And he had the audacity, in a press conference with Texas Democrats, to announce that he’s reconsidering [another redraw](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/pritzker-illinois-district-map-texas-democrats/) of Illinois’s already deeply partisan congressional map. \"I don't think you can gerrymander them anymore,\" former Illinois Republican Party chairman and political analyst Pat Brady told _CBS News_. \"We are the most gerrymandered political map in the country right now.\"\n\nPritzker is hosting 30 of Texas’ Democratic legislators. I don’t know where the others are hiding out. Meanwhile, Gov. Abbott is threatening to vacate their seats, citing an [opinion](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/opinion-files/opinion/2021/kp-0382.pdf) from Attorney General and 2026 GOP US Senate candidate Ken Paxton. “The Texas Supreme Court has long recognized that ‘\\[a] vacancy may be made by resignation, death, expiration of the term of office, abandonment, removal, or forfeiture,’ and that ‘\\[a]bandonment of an office is a species of resignation,’” [wrote](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/opinion-files/opinion/2021/kp-0382.pdf) Paxton in 2021.\n\n[![A political press conference with Illinois Gov.

JB Pritzker (D-IL), surrounded by Democratic legislators from Texas in Carol Stream, IL. Pritzker is preparing to run for a third term, despite Illinois being the fifth most taxed state in the nation and losing jobs and population.*\n\nA lot of this is posturing, on both sides. This little game of “Texas hold ‘em” is likely to slow, but not stop, the redistricting plan. Democrats dramatically flee state legislatures not only to draw media attention, but also to drive public opinion and hopefully put political pressure on Republicans. But history shows that such tactics rarely work.\n\nEspecially when you look really, _really_ hypocritical in the process. The irony of Texas Democrats fleeing to one of the most abusive examples of partisan redistricting is beyond obvious.\n\nI’m a little surprised the media didn’t press Pritzker or Texas Democrats on this point during their press conference at Carol Stream, Illinois, but only a little. We know whose side the media is on. Meanwhile, the gamesmanship continues. None of this is very attractive or interesting to everyday Americans. But Republicans hold the winning hand, at least at this juncture, and control of the US House _matters_. We’ll see what voters say in November 2026.\n\n[![Texas hold’em | Poker, Origin, Rules, Hands, & Facts | Britannica](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j5u7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c2eb58f-2b6a-405f-bbb2-edb5b78da742_474x316.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j5u7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c2eb58f-2b6a-405f-bbb2-edb5b78da742_474x316.jpeg)",
