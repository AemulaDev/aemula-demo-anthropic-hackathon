Around him, the towers rose unfinished—beige‑gray spires that looked like the ribcage of some shipwrecked cathedral. The wind came in low and dry, threading beneath his jacket collar. It should have meant work. Now it just hissed.\n\nTom didn’t follow politics the way some guys on the pier did. He followed work. For fifteen years he’d worked high steel—rigging, hoisting, bolting rings on these towers bound for offshore wind farms. He could point to them, name the men who’d fit each blade hub by hand. He didn’t need a briefing to know what had been abandoned.\n\nBehind him, the gates had padlocks. Concrete mixers sat idle under plastic sheeting, and the crew boards were wiped clean. What was supposed to be a decade‑long boom—the transformation of America’s offshore wind economy—had stalled in real time. Not from supply chains or storms. From one man’s vendetta.\n\nThat man now sat in the Oval Office again.\n\nThe stop‑work order hit like a shutter slamming in heavy wind. Tom first heard it on the radio, then saw the foreman’s truck idle long in the lot. At the union hall later that week, the usual noise had flattened.\n\n**“Let’s call the stop‑work order what it is,”** said Sean McGarvey of the Building Trades. **“President Donald Trump just fired 1,000 of our members.”¹**\n\nThe camera lights flickered on. The wind off Narragansett Bay pushed against their jackets.\n\n**“They don’t work when the wind stops.”²** That was the line Trump kept repeating on stage—at fundraisers, rallies, even during a FEMA briefing. In 2019, he’d called wind turbines a “graveyard for birds.” In 2020, he told a crowd in Colorado they caused cancer. By 2025, he didn’t bother with metaphors. **“Ridiculous.”³**\n\nWhat he hated more than the turbines was the way they looked—rising taller than the Statue of Liberty, visible from the decks of his golf courses in Scotland. Long before offshore wind reached the U.S. coastline, Trump had been fighting it in court, in Parliament, in the Scottish press. He once tried to force Aberdeenshire to remove their turbines on “aesthetic grounds.” He lost.\n\nBut Trump never really loses. He delays. He appeals. He finds smaller fights where he can win. The winds in Scotland blew east. But the grudge blew west.\n\nWhen Revolution Wind broke ground off Rhode Island, it was supposed to power 350,000 homes. Its construction terminal became the largest offshore wind facility in the country. Danish and American firms invested more than $100 billion in the pipeline. Thousands of workers like Tom moved north from Gulf Coast oil rigs, retraining in union halls.\n\nBy 2024, analysts projected over 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by the end of the decade. For a moment, it looked like the U.S. would leapfrog the North Sea.\n\nThen came the reversal. First, a White House executive order mandating “visual impact assessments” for all renewable energy permits. Then an immediate halt to all federal subsidies, retroactive to January. Then came the lawsuits.\n\n**“People don’t like seeing them out there,”** Trump said at a June rally. **“They like a nice view.”⁴**\n\nProject 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s second term, had quietly embedded language to strip renewable infrastructure of its “critical energy” designation. The fossil fuel lobby—now restaffed throughout Energy, Interior, and Commerce—rewrote grant eligibility rules. Investment dried up. Contracts dissolved. And the wind stopped meaning work.⁵\n\nTom didn’t remember the last time he’d gone a day without thinking about the future—even when the future was the one thing no one offered him anymore.\n\nHe lived in Cranston with his brother, near the old shipyard. His knees were shot, and the harness bruises didn’t fade like they used to. But what really scared him was standing still. The quiet. The sense that the world had turned, and he’d been left on a pier with nothing but steel, wind, and debt.\n\nIn Iowa, a woman named Mae leased her back fields to a turbine co‑op. **“The turbines pay for my son’s braces,”** she said. The wind had turned her land into something permanent. When the new order came, she wasn’t angry. She was quiet. “I guess they want us to go back to selling corn.”⁶\n\nThe headlines focused on GDP. But out here, that was ten thousand weeks of work. Some men went back to oil. Some to Amazon. A few tried HVAC. Most stayed. The towers were still upright, after all. Maybe someone would finish them.\n\nOpponents of offshore wind often cited harm to fisheries, bird strikes, or coastal views. But Rhode Island’s own environmental‑impact studies had already cleared the project. Local fishermen had joined the planning process. The biggest risk, it turned out, wasn’t turbines—it was government unreliability.\n\nTom picked up a discarded welding glove from the deck. The inside was still warm.\n\nIt’s not just power lines or ports. Each canceled turbine is one less leaf in a forest we need to build to dull the heat. Each idle rig is another gallon of sunlight, wasted and burned again through oil.\n\nHe thought of Mae again. Her son was ten. His own boy had gone into telecom. “Chased signal,” he’d called it. Tom hadn’t argued. What was there to stay for?\n\nThe wind kept pulling at the tarp seams, rattling against the steel. The towers still stood, skeletal—an unfinished cathedral waiting for a congregation that never came.\n\nThe wind didn’t know about politics. It only knew how to move—and how long it could outlast them. Whether the country could say the same was less clear.⁷\n\n⸻\n\n**Biibliography**\n\n1\\.
