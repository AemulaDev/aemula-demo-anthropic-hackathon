And without trust, persuasion simply doesn’t work.\n\n{{youtube:DOHBgOMMhPQ}}\n\nWhat struck me about this moment is how timeless it is.\n\nAristotle wasn’t talking about social media. He wasn’t talking about cable news. He was talking about human beings — and the simple truth that we don’t listen to people we don’t trust.\n\nThis applies everywhere: leadership, politics, family conversations, and even the quiet one-on-one moments where we decide whether to lean in… or tune out.\n\nCurious how this lands with you.\n\nWhat makes _you_ trust a speaker?",
