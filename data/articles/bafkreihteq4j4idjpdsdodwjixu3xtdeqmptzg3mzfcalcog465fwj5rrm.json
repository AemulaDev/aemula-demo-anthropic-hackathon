Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nThe first time I ever set foot in an official job was on February 12, 2022, at the Jimmy John’s in Longleaf Mall in Wilmington, North Carolina. It was also the first time I remember seeing snow, since, coincidentally, we had a rare winter storm on my first workday. I was thankful for the icy conditions because my first real day of work was slow and easy.\n\nI distinctly remember opening my first bank account at BB\\&T (now Truist) and depositing my first paycheck. At just $7.25 per hour, literally the federal minimum wage, it resulted in take-home pay of just $74.37. I was shocked that nearly 13 hours of effort resulted in so little cash in my account. Of course, Medicare, Social Security, and income taxes took a large chunk, even from a first-time job.\n\nLast week in _[The Only Two Things Investors Can Control](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/the-only-two-things-investors-can?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, we discussed how fees can make or break your long-term wealth building if you wind up overpaying. This week, we’re covering the only other thing investors can control: taxes, which can either be a source of additional growth or a significant drag on long-term performance.\n\nSuppose you and your buddy Oliver both take $1,000 from working over winter break and decide to invest it in the [S\\&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), the U.S. benchmark of large, profitable companies, with the intention of holding it for the long run.\n\nOliver opens a brokerage account and doesn’t venture beyond the main landing page. He misses seeing an Individual Retirement Account option or any other account types, so he puts the $1,000 into a regular brokerage account with no tax benefits.\n\nAfter reading a great short story about the power of a Roth IRA in _[The First Small Choice…](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-first-small-choice?r=3eob4x)_, you decide to open the tax-advantaged account instead.\n\nWhen it comes to investing-related taxes, there are multiple categories. Today, we’re zooming in on long-term capital gains, meaning gains on stocks held for at least a full year. This is one of the most important figures for long-term investors trying to build financial freedom.\n\nDepending on your income level, long-term gains can be taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%. However, if you make between roughly $50,000 and $500,000 a year, which is where the majority of Americans fall, you’ll be taxed at 15%, so we’ll use that rate for our example.\n\nAlthough you don’t face taxes on your S\\&P 500 investment until you sell it in a brokerage account, you will still pay taxes on the dividends it generates, which historically have been around 2%.\n\nAs always, you pay no taxes on any gains in a Roth, including dividends and selling your shares.\n\nWe’ll assume a 2% annual dividend and a 15% tax rate, since S\\&P 500 dividends are treated as qualified dividends and taxed as long-term capital gains.\n\nGoing back to you and your buddy Oliver, your $1,000 investments grow steadily until retirement, earning an annual return of 10%, the historical average for U.S. stocks. However, 15% of the 2% dividend yield amounts to a 0.3% yearly drag that Oliver must pay because his investment isn’t in a tax-sheltered account.\n\nHis effective annual return is 9.7%. While that difference may seem insignificant, as we learned last week when discussing fees, small numbers compound into significant outcomes.\n\nBy retirement, your Roth IRA is worth roughly $73,000. Oliver’s account is worth about $64,500, a difference of approximately $8,400, all from a $1,000 starting investment.\n\nLet’s take this one step further. Assuming both you and your friend follow the [25–500 plan](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x) and contribute $25 per week, Oliver ends up with $915,000, a successful outcome, but still less than your status as a millionaire, with a total ending value of $1,007,000. That’s a difference of about $92,000. Even a 0.3% annual drag from taxes on a relatively small dividend leads to meaningful results down the road.\n\nSo far, we’ve only accounted for the annual tax drag from dividends. Unfortunately for Oliver, there’s one more tax bill waiting at the finish line. He still has to pay a 15% lump-sum tax on his shares when he sells them, resulting in a $137,000 liability, leaving him with only $778,000, compared to your sum of over $1 million, which faces no taxes when withdrawn.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cm8l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c07aa5-e48a-4e30-a5bf-4177e24f207b_2528x1696.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cm8l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c07aa5-e48a-4e30-a5bf-4177e24f207b_2528x1696.png)\n\n{{caption:The same investment ends in radically different places depending on where it lives.}}\n\nYou’ve likely heard of “tax loopholes,” sneaky ways to break the system. In reality, the laws are designed to reward wise, disciplined savers who start early and invest consistently. While paying payroll taxes as I did with my first Jimmy John’s paycheck is unavoidable, taking advantage of tax-advantaged accounts is crucial if you want to provide for yourself later in life.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
