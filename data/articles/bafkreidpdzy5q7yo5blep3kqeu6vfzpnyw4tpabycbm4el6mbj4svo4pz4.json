  "body": "As we roll into the new year, I’ve been thinking a lot about what actually holds communities together when things feel strained.\n\nNot policies.\n\nNot platforms.\n\nNot shouting louder.\n\nOften, it’s something much smaller.\n\nIn this short clip from my recent conversation with Palma Joy Strand & Malka Kopell of Civity, Palma names it plainly: the tangible result isn’t changing the world — it’s building a relationship. Being seen. Being acknowledged. A hello. A moment of recognition.\n\nThose tiny moments don’t look like much.\n\nBut they add up.\n\nAnd over time, they change the culture we live inside.\n\nHere’s a moment worth sitting with.\n\n[Watch Clip](https://wilkwilkinson.substack.com/p/the-smallest-acts-matter-most)\n\nSometimes the most meaningful work we do doesn’t make headlines.\nIt just makes room for one another.\n\nGrateful you’re here.",
