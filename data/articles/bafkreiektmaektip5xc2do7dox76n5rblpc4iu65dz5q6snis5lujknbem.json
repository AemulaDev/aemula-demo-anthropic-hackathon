There’s something about the idea of boarding in one city and stepping off in another that feels right. And although Wilmington hasn’t had that option since 1968, I got to ride Brightline in Florida earlier this year, and it was everything Amtrak isn’t: fast, clean, and enjoyable. This essay was written back in December 2023 for my AP Lang class in high school, but the point feels even sharper today._\n\nOn March 2, 1968, the final passenger train left Wilmington and never returned. That's when the Seaboard Coast line ran its last train out of Wilmington, economically devastating the Cape Fear region. It's been 55 years, and while populations have skyrocketed on North Carolina's East Coast, a return in rail services remains elusive. Three years later, on May 1, 1971, Amtrak, the federal government’s passenger railroad corporation, was formed. Now, the government runs the only national passenger rail network in the United States. The inefficiencies of state-run corporations like Amtrak illustrate why competition through privatization is the best option for consumers, governments, and companies.\n\nOver the years, Amtrak's government-sanctioned monopoly has demonstrated inefficiencies inherent in state-run corporations. Conversely, privately funded companies like Brightline have underscored the need for privatization by reshaping the passenger rail landscape. Amtrak's inefficiencies become apparent when compared to Brightline's success. Brightline's passenger rail line from Miami to Orlando significantly reduces travel time and is profitable. The company owes its success to its strategic approach of providing efficient, high-speed service without unnecessary amenities and investing in dedicated infrastructure. This starkly contrasts Amtrak, which faces challenges such as prioritizing freight trains over passenger services, resulting in delays and abysmal service quality. Amtrak rarely owns the tracks it operates on and relies on freight companies' existing infrastructure to run trains, leading to freight boxes receiving priority over passengers.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the competitive dynamics. Brightline prioritizes customer satisfaction, efficiency, and profitability while operating in a competitive environment that forces innovation. In contrast, as a publicly subsidized entity, Amtrak lacks the same imperative to innovate, compete, and deliver optimal service to passengers, leading to complacency and a worse experience for consumers. Despite being labeled a for-profit corporation, Amtrak has never turned a profit in its 50-year history, emphasizing the drawbacks of a system without market-driven competition.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PguW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F879c63f3-e9b7-4583-b3d0-d43db88be9ec_556x989.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PguW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F879c63f3-e9b7-4583-b3d0-d43db88be9ec_556x989.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:From my trip in the spring of 2025}}\n\nPrivate package distributors like UPS and FedEx further reinforce the benefits of competition. Private carriers must cut costs, innovate, and adapt to changing market demands. At the same time, the United States Postal Service (USPS) faces different market pressures, if any at all, since it receives government funding. This competition lowers consumer costs and fosters a dynamic market environment, forcing continual improvement.\n\nThe government's malfeasance and Amtrak's complacency are responsible for the sluggish progress in the development of train service to Wilmington. The hope is that increased privatization in the United States will pave the way for more companies like Brightline to enter the market, offering superior services and driving overall quality up while pushing prices down. Ultimately, a competitive landscape in the passenger rail industry is essential for businesses to thrive, innovate, and provide consumers with the freedom to choose services that best suit their needs.\n\n_Brightline feels like modern travel. Amtrak feels like the DMV decided to buy a train set, and that’s why American passenger rail has barely budged in 55 years._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
