  "title": "Part I: Predictions, and Resolutions for 2026",
  "preview": "It's that time of year again. I have wishes, predictions, and resolutions for you, me, and policy makers in Washington and elsewhere. Part one will focus on predictions.",
  "body": "_The first part of a two-part series._\n\nResolutions generally are a waste of time. Quick, do you remember the ones you made last year? But they don’t have to be a waste if you look at them as part of a planning process. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, \"Plans are worthless, but planning is _essential_.\"\n\nI’ve organized this into three categories, which I look forward to revisiting a year from now, if I remain a resident of this terrestrial plane: Resolutions for me, resolutions for thee (people in general), and predictions, wishes, and resolutions for our policy makers in Washington and a few states.\n\nI make a few _several_ predictions here, [as I did last year](https://kellyjohnston.substack.com/p/the-continuing-crisis-predictions?utm_source=publication-search). How did I do? I batted around .500, but no better, and probably worse if I’m being honest. I was wrong that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination as HHS Secretary would be withdrawn; that Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would be Prime Minister (good run, but fell short thanks to the cretinous Justin Trudeau being replaced at the last minute as Liberal leader by current Prime Minister Mark Carney, which I did not predict); and that Iran’s ruling class of oligarchical mullahs would collapse as people revolted (nope; wishful thinking).\n\nI’m not expecting most of these to come true, if any at all, but if geopolitical forecaster George Friedman can write and sell books with [wild predictions about the next 100 years](https://www.amazon.com/Next-100-Years-Forecast-Century/dp/0767923057) (Mexico emerges as a world power? _Really?_ Japan attacks the USA from the Moon?), why can’t I do the same about the next 12 months?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yI3d!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff027e7c4-49f5-45c2-99e4-fbb071f1a243_1020x574.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yI3d!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff027e7c4-49f5-45c2-99e4-fbb071f1a243_1020x574.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Not the Prime Minister of Canada.}}\n\nI also predicted that Republicans would win at least one governor’s race in 2025, probably New Jersey (big nope). I also thought Biden would pardon himself (nope) and a few family members (yes, _[big time](https://oversight.house.gov/blog/comer-on-fox-news-biden-crime-family-pardons-serve-as-a-confession-of-their-corruption/)_) as he shuffled out the White House door one final time.\n\nBut I was right about a few things. I said House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) would keep his job but not without drama (no kidding), and that Donald Trump’s earliest success would come from the border (a resounding yes, but not without political and legal challenges, and a few mistakes). I correctly predicted that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be extended but would exacerbate a deficit that I predicted then would rise to $40 trillion by the end of 2026. It will be close, _but I bet we hit it_.\n\nHere are a few predictions for 2026, a mid-term election year. Part two will get into resolutions.\n\n**Congress and the White House will produce no significant legislation in 2026, and the government will shut down again in January, and probably more than once next ytear - but none for very long.**\n\nThis is an easy one. When our policymakers clumsily ended the longest government shutdown in American history early last month, it set the stage for another shutdown at the end of January. To their credit, Congress has been trying to get to “regular order” on appropriations bills, but I don’t see much hope that they will complete them on time. Most likely, there will be a last-minute long-term continuing resolution or omnibus appropriations bill (or two) that will lock in the status quo for the remainder of this forgettable Fiscal Year (2026).\n\n_If you thought partisanship was driving gridlock in 2025, you ain’t seen nothin’, yet._\n\n**The federal debt will hit $40 trillion, and America will yawn.**\n\nThe federal debt hit $38 trillion this year. Despite a healthy economy that fuels federal revenue growth and a modicum of spending restraint (don’t laugh), we will see another trillion-dollar-plus deficit, which I predict will hit $40 trillion sometime between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day 2027. It could happen sooner, however. I’ll further predict that America will remain the world’s reserve currency, because if it doesn’t, _[Katy bar the door on a massive debt crisis](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/uk-budget-debate-us-debt-lessons-38bc52e3?utm_source=substack\\&utm_medium=email)_ _that will finally arrive. But not in 2026._\n\nAnd in election years, politicians from both parties will bend over backwards to buy your vote, either with tax cuts (a Republican favorite) or more government spending (the Democratic reflex).\n\n**Democrats will narrowly win control of the US House of Representatives, but their electoral wins will be smaller than historical standards, as redistricting schemes will worsen toxic polarization. Republicans will keep control of the US Senate and might add a seat.**\n\nThe party in power typically loses over 20 seats in mid-term elections, even more during the “six-year itch,” or the second midterm of a “reelected” president. But the fact is that there are no more than a dozen truly competitive House seats, thanks to massive partisan redistricting in several states that are designed to make more seats less competitive. This means that toxic polarization - Members of Congress are more worried about competitive primaries from their loony bases than appealing to swing or more moderate voters - will worsen.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Wxf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73fbfa61-d1b7-42f2-aa9e-f936eeae36ad_359x220.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Wxf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73fbfa61-d1b7-42f2-aa9e-f936eeae36ad_359x220.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Future Speaker of the House?}}\n\nSecondary prediction: Republicans hold the House by fewer than five seats right now, depending on vacancies. **After the next election, the Democratic margin will be no bigger than that - certainly less than 10 seats.**\n\nWe have entered a dangerous new era in which congressional gridlock and toxic polarization will prevent the resolution of our most pressing issues, leading to a stronger executive branch and the inevitable court clashes over Constitutional checks and balances. While democracy is threatened from dirty voter roles and bad election laws (election day registration, voting by mail, extensive early voting periods, poor voter ID requirements, etc.), the Constitution is under way more stress.\n\nAnother secondary prediction: a slim Democratic majority will fail to impeach President Trump, multiple times, _but not without trying_. US Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY) will emerge as a major player in the Democratic caucus as one of its very few politically sane members; watch for him to be primaried and/or reapportioned out of office by angry _Democrats_. The House “Problem Solvers Caucus” will emerge as a major player in the new 120th Congress, but that’s a prediction for 2027. Not in 2026.\n\n**The economy will be strong with lower inflation and interest rates finally being felt by beleaguered consumers - but not for health and auto insurance or electricity prices that will continue to escalate as policy makers keep grappling with eliminating coal plants and replacing them with unreliable and expensive “renewable” wind and solar energy.**\n\n“Affordability,” or frustration with the lack of progress on the battle to curb inflation, was the top issue in 2025. It will continue, but Democrats will find less success on this issue than they think as the effect of lower fuel and commodity prices and the quiet elimination or reduction of tariffs begins to be slowly felt. A 4.6 percent growth rate in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) was clearly achieved in the fourth quarter of 2025 and, barring a major international shock, is likely to continue. And the stock market in 2026 will look a lot like 2025 with more ups than downs, but pay attention to over-investments and losses in AI (artificial intelligence) and the inevitable shake-out in that growing sector.\n\n**The war in Ukraine will begin to end, but the peace agreement will be very shaky and could fall apart.**\n\nThanks as much to Donald Trump flooding the world in cheap oil the way Ronald Reagan did to destroy the USSR, Trump is on the verge of achieving an end (or at least a _pause_) to hostilities in Ukraine. I’ll predict that “the deal” will include allowing Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine to become “autonomous” zones with internationally supervised elections that would enable locals to choose their governments. Ukraine will not join NATO, and no NATO forces will be stationed there, other than some European peacekeepers acting in their individual national capacities, sans American troops. The western world, including seized Russian assets, will contribute to the rebuilding war-torn areas. Trump will demand cut-rate Ukrainian assets, including minerals and other agricultural byproducts, in exchange for US dollars being spent on the war-torn nation’s rebuild. It will be an uneasy peace, if that.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N51z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b79de33-0a6c-47f2-a0a7-d53411bb222c_843x842.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N51z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b79de33-0a6c-47f2-a0a7-d53411bb222c_843x842.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:His days as President of Ukraine are numbered.}}\n\nSecondary prediction: President Zelenskyy of Ukraine will not be the president by this time next year. And Putin will begin to face serious unrest in Russia as citizens start to recoil from the devastating effects of war on their people and economy. The question I have is whether the peace deal will result in the US and Europe bailing out the Russian economy.\n\n**Africa will emerge as the new battleground between Sino/Russian and western competition, as the US looks for new, reliable sources of “rare earth” minerals and other strategic advantages.**\n\nChina will not take kindly to a noticeable shift of focus away from them and their [failing “Belt and Road Initiative](https://vrfbharat.org/why-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-is-failing-with-no-coherent-plan-and-no-end-in-sight/)” to the United States. But they have too many problems at home to do much about it.\n\n**The United States will continue to make significant strategic gains in South America, including seeing the end of the Maduro regime and likely collapse of Cuba’s communist government.**\n\nThe US is already winning in the region through stronger ties with Argentina and, now, Chile. The US embargo of the Maduro narco-terror regime will result in Maduro seeking refuge elsewhere and the likely fall of the Cuban government. This will be Trump’s and, by extension, Marco Rubio’s most significant foreign policy success in 2026 as the Monroe Doctrine is restored. The Venezuelan embargo is squeezing Cuba, and Russia and China (nor Iran) are in no position to bail them out - but _watch this space_.\n\nI’m not predicting this yet, but the fall of Cuba could result in the US sweeping in to restore/maintain order and establish a new democratic government. Watch Trump offer to make Cuba the new 51st State (_bad idea_), but starting off an an unincorporated US territory like Puerto Rico. But he will make he’s portrayed as the Great Liberator. Cuba is an economic disaster that will take hundreds of billions of dollars and decades rebuild. It will create new tensions with Canada as the US works to restore property rights from lands stolen by the Castro regime, which Canadian companies have used for decades. _Watch this space_.\n\n_Maybe Marco Rubio will run for the presidency of Cuba instead of America._\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VyUu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f810e2c-c6e9-4a70-88b9-27879d6f0743_784x1168.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VyUu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f810e2c-c6e9-4a70-88b9-27879d6f0743_784x1168.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:AI Image from Grok of El Presidente Marco Rubio. Viva Libre Cuba!}}\n\n**JD Vance won’t be coronated as the heir apparent as the GOP nominee for President, at least in 2026, as potential competitors test the waters.**\n\nSecretary of State Rubio’s success in Latin America, especially if Cuba’s regime fails, will vault him into a leading position to challenge Vice President Vance, if he chooses. He has said he will support Vance, but we’ll see. Governor Ron DeSantis, Senator Rand Paul, and possibly Senator Ted Cruz will actively consider their own candidacies. So might outgoing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, but look for Vice President Vance to engineer a major ambassadorial appointment for Youngkin, probably to China. It wouldn’t be a bad place for Youngkin to hang out for a couple of years.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zZbT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3dbc8f-3ed9-4871-86a1-dfa7cd30e7d4_789x460.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zZbT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3dbc8f-3ed9-4871-86a1-dfa7cd30e7d4_789x460.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Future Ambassador or Presidential candidate? Or both?}}\n\nVance is still favored to be the nominee in 2028, but that’s not going to deter several leading Republicans from testing the waters. Look for the people I just mentioned to ramp up national political efforts in support of GOP congressional and Senate candidates for the 2026 election.\n\nA few other fun predictions:\n\nThe Buffalo Bills will come from behind to defeat the San Francisco 49ers to win the Superbowl LX (February 8th, in Santa Clara, CA), _in overtime_.\n\n[![3 reasons to get hyped about Colorado Avalanche in 2026](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WUKs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa9845e9-d35d-4489-a327-5990ca9b834b_720x405.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WUKs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa9845e9-d35d-4489-a327-5990ca9b834b_720x405.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The NHL’s Colorado Avalanche are really, really good. Unstoppable, even.}}\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche will win the Stanley Cup, defeating the surprising Detroit Red Wings in a boring and lopsided four-game sweep. The real Stanley Cup final will be the Western Conference final between the Avalanche and the Dallas Stars. The Washington Capitals and the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Florida Panthers, will both fail to make the playoffs. Alexander Ovechkin will retire after a dismal 2025-26 season and return to Russia permanently to play in the KHL, as rumors begin to swirl about his future in Russian politics.\n\nVirginia voters will narrowly reject a public referendum on new partisan congressional districts designed by power-mad Democrats in Richmond.\n\nThere will be no clear favorite as dozens of Democrats launch candidacies for the 2026 presidential election.\n\n**There will be no vacancies from the Supreme Court in 2026.** _**But watch 2027**_.\n\nThe Senate’s filibuster (Rule XXII requires a super-majority of 60 votes to end debate on legislation) will continue to survive, but not without more pressure from Donald Trump and GOP Senate defections.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kR2c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb319cb11-6814-494e-971e-57a797863d7e_579x610.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kR2c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb319cb11-6814-494e-971e-57a797863d7e_579x610.png)\n\nCongress will fail to produce a budget or a “reconciliation” bill in 2026, mostly thanks to divisions within House GOP ranks. House retirements will continue to grow to historic levels in early 2026, driven by redistricting and frustration.\n\n**There will be a second and potentially lengthy government shutdown as the new Fiscal Year begins on October 1st without a budget or a single appropriations bill.**\n\nSeveral politicians and government officials in several states will be indicted and possibly convicted over Medicaid and other federal program fraud, especially in Minnesota.\n\nTim Walz will be defeated in his reelection bid as Governor of Minnesota if he doesn’t withdraw from the race first, especially if he’s indicted. Bonus points if the corrupt Attorney General, Keith Ellison, also leaves office, either via the voters by handcuffs. Or both.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9CeT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c5e7941-37bd-4f2e-8d03-0333a5b3968f_800x571.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9CeT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c5e7941-37bd-4f2e-8d03-0333a5b3968f_800x571.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Americans in 2026 will slowly begin to realize that the US Democratic Party is little more than a criminal enterprise.}}\n\nSteve Hilton will make the runoff as the GOP “nominee” for Governor of California, but will narrowly lose the general election to Antonio Villaraigosa. But if the execrable former US Rep. Katie Porter is the leading Democrat, _all bets are off_. Despite losing control of the US House, the GOP is likely to pick up a couple of governorships, including Kansas and in at least one of the three M’s - Maine, Minnesota, or Michigan.\n\nNot a single GOP incumbent will lose reelection for the US Senate in 2026, but Democrats will narrowly win with former Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina. Former US Rep. Mike Rodgers will score an upset win as the new GOP Senator from Michigan in 2026, as Democratic infighting in the Great Lakes State boosts his candidacy. There will be no net change in the partisan ratio of the US Senate, currently at 53-47. But watch the political dynamics with an open Senate seat in Mogadishu Minnesota. A GOP pickup in the US Senate to 54 seats is quite possible, but I’m not prepared to predict that.\n\nNever underestimate the ability of Republicans to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nI make no predictions about the Middle East, other than the Abraham Accords will be expanded by at least one nation and the region remains relatively peaceful in 2026. Binyamin Netanyahu will face a political crisis as his coalition teeters on the eldge of collapse over plans to rebuild Gaza, which will also result in conflicts with Donald Trump and neighboring Arab nations. An election can’t be ruled out, and no, [Natanyahu won’t be pardoned](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv76r5qpvo). If there is an election in Israel in 2026, Netanyahu and his party will lose.\n\nFinally, a long-shot prediction: Donald Trump will successfully negotiate a 2027 non-binding referendum in Greenland to become part of the United States. No prediction on how it will turn out, but he shouldn’t get his hopes up.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ife6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e55b395-64ff-4679-b5e6-134c69e4f1b6_738x587.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ife6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e55b395-64ff-4679-b5e6-134c69e4f1b6_738x587.jpeg)\n\n_AI was used to create one photograph, but despite your suspicions, no alcohol was consumed in the crafting of this post._",
