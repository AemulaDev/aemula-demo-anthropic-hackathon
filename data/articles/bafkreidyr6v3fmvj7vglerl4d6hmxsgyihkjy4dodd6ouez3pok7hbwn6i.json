  "body": "[Watch Episode](https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/p/a-voice-in-the-conservative-wilderness)\n\nBen Connelly—the podcast’s first non-Neophyte repeat guest!—is a brilliant writer and long-distance runner based out of one of Earth’s Top Cities Where Nick Hagen Once Lived, Charlottesville, Virginia. Though he spends most of his writing time working on the serialized novels, short stories, and essays he publishes on his [Hardihood Books](https://hardihoodbooks.substack.com/) Substack, he also writes political essays on his [Carrying the Fire](https://carryingthefire.substack.com/) Substack under the pseudonym John Grady Atreides.\n\nConnelly is a self-described fusionist conservative, “fusionism” being the product of the union of libertarianism and traditionalism which dominated the Republican Party for much of the last fifty or so years. Connelly is deeply knowledgeable and thoroughly reasoned; I’m pretty sure he knows _my_ positions better than I do—completely sure, if I’m being honest—and he states his own positions well enough that if the podcast were much longer I might accidentally come out ready to extol the virtues of Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nGiven the current populist, nationalist lean of the Republican Party, Connelly is a man without a comfortable political home, but I think he’s still a man worth listening to; on this, his second visit to the welcoming waters of open, Never-Closed Inquiries, we discussed Venezuela, Greenland, and what we might generically call ICE’s efforts in Minneapolis, plus a whole lot more.\n\n***\n\n*This article reproduces content from Never Close the Inquiry, written by Nick Hagen, and is available at* *<https://neverclosetheinquiry.substack.com/>.
