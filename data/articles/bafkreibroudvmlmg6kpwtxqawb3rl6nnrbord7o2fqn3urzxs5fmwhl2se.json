  "body": "We’re still on vacation in Canada, tucked into an Airbnb on a rocky promontory overlooking the Atlantic. The wind is blowing, the rain keeps coming, and the surf is putting on a fine show. We’re not far from Peggy’s Cove, where yesterday we visited the quiet memorial to Swissair Flight 111.\n\nI’ve met a few readers here who follow my articles—always gratifying—and I hope they’ll leave a comment or two. Canadians are remarkably well-informed about what’s happening in the U.S. They’re also deeply concerned. Many are watching Trump’s saber-rattling toward Venezuela and wondering, as I do, whether it’s really about drug routes—or whether Venezuela and Colombia are being eyed as the 51st and 52nd states. They do, after all, have some very nice beaches to develop.\n\nThat got me thinking about how dictators, or those who wish to be, often look for a war to boost support at home. And that, in turn, reminded me of a movie.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pZgm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff765830-0d6d-41d6-983c-bc02fb1c720b_508x285.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pZgm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff765830-0d6d-41d6-983c-bc02fb1c720b_508x285.jpeg)\n\nIt started with the sound of hockey. Not the crowd—there wasn’t one—but the slap of a puck echoing off an empty metal bleacher in Niagara Falls, New York. Sheriff Bud Boomer didn’t even flinch. He was used to it, just like he was used to the jokes about Canada, the cutbacks to his department, and the new “threat assessment” briefing from the White House: they walk among us.\n\nBy the time Bud climbed into his squad car that morning, the U.S. was technically at peace but politically on fire. President Alan Alda—playing the unnamed commander-in-chief in Michael Moore’s _Canadian Bacon_—had poll numbers falling faster than a rust-belt bridge. His advisors, led by the smug James Allen (Kevin Pollak), had a plan: if you can’t win peace, manufacture war. Just not with anyone who might shoot back.\n\nThey chose Canada.\n\nThe justification came wrapped in flags and recycled Cold War fear. It didn’t matter that the biggest scandal on the northern border was too much maple syrup. A media campaign was launched. CNN whispered war in an anchor’s voice. “Canadian terrorists,” one chyron warned, “disguised as French-speaking comedians.” NBC aired grainy footage of moose. And Bud? He was deputized into something larger than himself—a farcical crusade with a real badge.\n\nThe film played it for laughs. But almost thirty years later, the punchlines feel like warning shots.\n\n_“Subliminally, America has been conditioned to accept the idea that national security justifies anything—tariffs, troops, or a war against poutine.”_\n\nThat’s not a joke. That’s policy.\n\nThe order wasn’t shouted. It arrived by printer hum and keystroke—another “Emergency Use Justification” stamped in triplicate. After 9/11, the dusty relic of the National Emergencies Act found breath again. Bush revived it. Obama renewed it. Trump hijacked it. Biden inherited the rhythm. By 2025, more than forty emergencies still hum in the background—some older than TikTok, none ever voted down¹.\n\n_In Moore’s world, the same machinery hums beneath the comedy—an unseen engine that turns fear into governance._\n\nMichael Moore wasn’t just riffing on George H. W. Bush’s 90% Gulf War approval ratings—he was spotlighting the system that makes fear profitable. In _Canadian Bacon_, that system is Global Armaments, a fictional defense contractor with a clear real-world analog. In 2024 alone, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon reported record profits, driven by sales to “strategic partners” from Poland to Taiwan¹⁰. When fear surges, stocks follow.\n\nBut Moore knew spectacle alone wouldn’t hold. You need media complicity.\n\nSo the film gives us Roseanne Barr as a frenzied talk-show host screaming about Canadian plots. The line between satire and CNN’s “BREAKING NEWS” banners has since vanished. Four years later, _Wag the Dog_ premiered—another satire about a fake war, this time to distract from a presidential scandal. The timing wasn’t prescient. It was practically real-time. In August 1998, just as Ken Starr prepared to deliver his report on the Lewinsky affair, President Clinton ordered a missile strike on Sudan. The airstrike destroyed a pharmaceutical plant⁴. The news cycle shifted.\n\n_“When the cameras turn, history turns with them. The danger isn’t the lie—it’s the choreography.”_\n\nThat choreography danced again under Donald Trump. In 2018, he invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act—on national-security grounds—to slap tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum⁸. Canada? A threat to U.S. security? The justification sounded absurd, but it held in court. America’s closest ally, suddenly rebranded as an economic adversary.\n\nRetaliation came dressed in manners. Canadian officials imposed counter-tariffs—including one on ketchup. In Ottawa, a laid-off steelworker named Alex Larouche told the _Toronto Star_, “It wasn’t even American ketchup. It was Heinz, but made here. They still taxed it.” Ontario factories slowed. American jobs wobbled. The war wasn’t fought with bullets—it was fought with trade policy and talk radio. But the playbook? Lifted straight from _Canadian Bacon_.\n\nSheriff Bud Boomer’s slow-burn descent into paranoid nationalism might seem over-the-top today—until you turn on Newsmax or scroll Truth Social. Replace “Canadian socialist plots” with “globalist cabals” or “deep-state pedophiles,” and the absurd becomes procedural. In a media environment where engagement is currency, outrage pays.\n\n_“The villain doesn’t have to be real—just visible. Flags make the best blindfolds.”_\n\nWhen Hearst promoted _Gabriel Over the White House_ in 1933—a film about a president dissolving Congress and ruling as a benevolent dictator—he called it “a prophecy”⁹. That film was backed by fascists. Moore’s was backed by comedians. But both asked the same question: what happens when the law becomes theater?\n\nMoore’s movie wasn’t subtle. It was broad, messy, and too long. Theaters ignored it. History didn’t. Buried under slapstick was a savage truth: presidents don’t need real enemies. They need useful ones.\n\n“Canadians walk among us,” says one breathless U.S. security official in the film, pointing out that William Shatner and Alex Trebek both passed for American for years. It’s a joke. But in 2025, the same logic powers school-board purges, state textbook bans, and election-denier campaigns. If the enemy can look like anyone—your neighbor, your teacher, your son—then anyone can be deputized to stop them.\n\n_“The machinery doesn’t need a villain—it just needs believers.”_\n\nThe real irony? Moore’s movie imagines a nation distracted by invented fear while real problems—deindustrialization, inequality, mental illness—go untreated. That’s not a farce. That’s Tuesday.\n\nAnd Bud Boomer, the earnest dolt with a badge and a baton? He’s not the villain. He’s us.\n\nSometimes I wonder whether Moore laughed when he saw the headlines catch up to his farce.\n\nBy the final scene, Bud has realized the war is fake. He tears down the propaganda posters. But the machinery grinds on. He didn’t build it. He just believed it.\n\nThe puck echoes again. Not in Canada—but in a sheriff’s locker room in Arizona, a war room in D.C., a school-board meeting in Ohio where the next enemy is being chosen by vote. The bleachers are still empty. But somewhere, another Bud is getting the call.\n\nOutside, the surf keeps pounding against the rocks, steady as breath. The wind still howls. The same Atlantic that once swallowed a plane now swallows the sound of one more anthem beginning.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\. “National Emergency Powers.” _Congressional Research Service_, updated March 2020.
