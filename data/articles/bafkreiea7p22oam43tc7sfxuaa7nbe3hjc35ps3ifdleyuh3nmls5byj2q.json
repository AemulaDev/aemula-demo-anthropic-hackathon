  "body": "I’m increasingly frustrated by bad arguments and practices around immigration.\n\nWhether it’s the Trump administration arguing that due process and free speech— both Constitutional protections and one a natural right— don’t apply to non-citizens, regardless of their legal status, or Democrats simultaneously complaining that the deportation of exploited illegal workers will increase food costs and advocating for higher minimum wages, I’ve realized that almost no one actually understands immigration law. I began writing about this months ago, but news on the topic has moved rapidly, and I realized the topic was far too complicated and broad for a single post.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s begin with **asylum.**\n\nThe legal definition of asylum (taken directly from the Immigration and Naturalization Act) is: Legal protection granted to a refugee outside his or her own country, who has “establish\\[ed] that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant” in his or her country of nationality, or in the case of a statesless person, in his or her last habitual residence. The primary difference between a refugee and an asylum applicant is that other types of refugees might have their applications for legal residency processed while still residing in their home country. Asylum applicants, on the other hand, apply at a port of entry or upon arrival in the US via other means.\n\nHere are my priors on asylum:\n\n1. The existence of the asylum process is good.\n2. The asylum scheme has long had gaps, but has been broken to a new degree by the existence and accessibility of the internet and social media.\n3. Local resource constraints are real and must be carefully considered.\n4. I’m most concerned with adherence to enumerated Constitutional rights, concerned about adherence to unenumerated Constitutional rights, and least concerned about adherence to statutory law, especially if the law has not yet been through judicial review. All are important, but the significance of a challenge differs in my eyes. I’m almost entirely blasé about challenges to statutory interpretation. I’m **extremely** concerned about challenges to the interpretation of enumerated Constitutional provisions.\n5. What is legal is not the same as moral or ethical practice. I am more concerned with whether a practice is legal than whether it is moral or ethical, because we have elections and other ways to advocate for changing what the law is, and debates over the morality and ethics of current law are common. I will use legal definitions for words in this post and do my best to note whether my concerns are legal, practical, or ethical.\n\nThere are four federal agency acronyms you will need to be familiar with for the rest of this piece.\n\n* **Department of Homeland Security (DHS):** After 9/11, Congress voted to create the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate a broad range of border security, emergency, and counter-terror apparatuses. They oversee many agencies, including ICE, CBP, FEMA, USCIS, US Coast Guard, and CISA.\n* **Customs and Border Patrol (CBP):** You will encounter these agents at Ports of Entry, which is their job to control.\n* **Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):** They engage in removal (arrest and deportation operations) in the interior United States and collaborate with the FBI on investigating and disrupting transnational crime.\n* **United States Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS):** They manage applications and determinations for legal immigration, citizenship, temporary visas, and adjustments of status (changing visa type, applications for legal residency after illegal residency).\n\nThere are two other miscellaneous items it’s important for you to know.\n\n* **Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA):** This is the body of statutory law that defines immigration processes into the United States.\n* The difference between Constitutional law, statutory law, and administrative law is as follows:\n  * **Constitutional law** means the enumerated words written in the Constitution and judicial holdings (precedent) interpreting enumerated and unenumerated Constitutional rights, freedoms, and obligations of government.\n  * **Federal Statutory law** includes bills passed by Congress that have not been vetoed, declared unconstitutional by the courts or permanently enjoined ( with the enjoinment never overturned) from enforcement, and judicial holdings (precedent) interpreting their meaning.\n  * **Federal Administrative law** is written by federal agencies at the directive of Congress to enable or fulfill compliance with federal statutory law. Administrative law must follow the Administrative Procedures Act and is most often invalidated by courts finding that either the Administrative Procedures Act wasn’t thoroughly and precisely followed or that the administrative law exceeds the bounds of agency rule-making and requires Congressional action to effect.\n\nFinally, before continuing, you should understand a little bit about America’s immigration history. For that, I recommend reading [this](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/brief-history-us-immigration-policy-colonial-period-present-day#voluntary-forced-migration) CATO piece and [this history of refugee law and policy](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/our-history/stories-from-the-archives/refugee-timeline) from the USCIS’s website.\n\n**Current Asylum Law (Immigration and Naturalization Act)\\\nAsylum Application Process:** *Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States* (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien's status, *may apply for asylum* in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.\n\n* *The burden of proof is on the applicant* to establish that the applicant is a refugee, within the meaning listed above. To establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of such section, the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\n* *The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient* to sustain the applicant's burden *without corroboration, but only if* the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that *the applicant's testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee*. In determining whether the applicant has met the applicant's burden, the trier of fact may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record. *Where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence* that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, *such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.*\n* Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, *a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness's account, the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements* (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), *the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record* (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), *and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim*, or any other relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility; however, if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.\n* **Exceptions to Disqualification:** Unaccompanied alien children cannot be sent to a third safe country and are not subject to the timeliness requirement.\n* **Reasons for Asylum Disqualification:**\n  * There’s a third safe country where the alien can live freely without persecution and where the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection.\n  * The asylum application was filed late. (1+ yr after the alien’s arrival in the US)\n  * A previous application for asylum was denied, and the alien’s circumstances have not changed.\n  * The alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n  * The alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States.\n  * There are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United States.\n  * There are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States.\n  * The alien is determined to have a communicable disease of public health significance.\n  * The alien (if over the age of 10) has not been vaccinated against mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, pertussis, influenza type B and hepatitis B, and any other vaccinations against vaccine-preventable diseases recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices.\n  * The alien is determined to have or have previously had a physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others (if in the past, that is likely to reoccur).\n  * The alien is determined to be a drug abuser or addict.\n  * The alien was convicted of, or admits having committed, or admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of:\n    * a crime involving moral turpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime, or\n    * a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance\n  * The alien has been convicted of 2 or more offenses (other than purely political offenses) for which the aggregate sentences to confinement were 5 years or more.\n  * The alien is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance or in any listed chemical, or is or has been a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator, or colluder with others in the illicit trafficking in any such controlled or listed substance or chemical, or endeavored to do so\n  * The alien is the spouse, son, or daughter of a trafficker, and has, within the previous 5 years, obtained any financial or other benefit from the illicit activity of that alien, and knew or reasonably should have known that the financial or other benefit was the product of such illicit activity.\n  * The alien is coming to the United States solely, principally, or incidentally to engage in prostitution, or has engaged in prostitution within 10 years of the date of application.\n  * The alien directly or indirectly procures or attempts to procure, or within 10 years of the date of application procured or attempted to procure or to import, prostitutes or persons for the purpose of prostitution, or receives or (within such 10-year period) received, in whole or in part, the proceeds of prostitution.\n  * The alien is coming to the United States to engage in any other unlawful commercialized vice, whether or not related to prostitution.\n  * The alien has committed in the United States at any time a serious criminal offense.\n    * The alien received immunity from criminal jurisdiction and as a consequence of the offense and exercise of immunity, has departed from the United States, and\n    * Has not subsequently submitted fully to the jurisdiction of the court in the United States having jurisdiction with respect to that offense.\n  * The alien commits or conspires to commit human trafficking offenses anywhere in the world or the consular officer, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, or the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe the alien is or has been a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator, or colluder with such a trafficker in severe forms of trafficking in persons.\n  * The consular officer or the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe the alien is the spouse, son, or daughter of an alien inadmissible due to being a human trafficker or having aided, abetted, assisted, colluded, or conspired with a trafficker, has, within the previous 5 years, obtained any financial or other benefit from the illicit activity of that alien, and knew or reasonably should have known that the financial or other benefit was the product of such illicit activity.\n    * Exception: The son or daughter was a child at the time of their benefit from or involvement in their parent’s criminal activity.\n  * Money laundering\n  * Espionage\n  * Corporate espionage\n  * Sabotage\n  * Insurrection or overthrow of the government\n  * Terrorism or support for it\n  * The alien was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.\n  * The Secretary of State believes the alien’s admission would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nIn summary, there’s an ***extraordinarily long*** list of ways to be disqualified from asylum, and being approved is a long shot that requires a lot of investigation and time spent collecting evidence that you would be subject to inescapable persecution for a short list of reasons.\n\nFor decades, the US admitted fewer than 100,000 asylees per year and most applicants were granted asylum. [You can see](https://ohss.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/2024_1002_ohss_asylees_fy2023.pdf) that in the 2010’s though, applications climbed, then skyrocketed in 2021 with President Biden entering office.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qzOS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ea080bf-1f60-427b-968f-7994eef83a0c_1610x764.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qzOS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ea080bf-1f60-427b-968f-7994eef83a0c_1610x764.png)\n\nThough the number of refugee visas granted to asylum applicants stayed practically flat, the majority of these applicants were admitted to the US on “humanitarian parole” and allowed to live and work under Biden, whereas Trump had made most of them wait in a Third Safe Country.\n\n* “Third Safe Country” agreements require people applying for asylum to apply in the first safe country in which they arrive and wait there for their claim to be processed and either accepted or denied. Under the first Trump administration, America had agreements with Canada, Paraguay, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, though the latter three only came online at the end of 2020 and so were never used. Additionally, in 2018, the first Trump Administration instituted what it called “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which became known colloquially as the “Remain in Mexico” policy and had a similar effect to Third Safe Country Agreements (TSCA).\n  * President Biden promptly reversed the Remain in Mexico Policy and all Third Safe Country Agreements except with Canada. These policies were criticized by Democrats primarily because except for Canada, the governments in these countries aren’t very protective of their own people, who make up a portion of asylum applicants. As you read above, though, asylum protects people from very specific kinds of persecution. It isn’t supposed to be a fast pass compared to other immigration types nor is it designed to rescue people from poverty.\n* [Title 42](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter6A\\&edition=prelim), subsection 265, was used by Trump and Biden, in the name of preventing the spread of Covid-19, to expel people attempting to enter the US at the southern border. This allowed people encountered at a border by CBP or ICE to be immediately rejected and returned to their home countries. However, because this was about preventing the spread of disease during a public health emergency, these expulsions did not legally count as deportations, meaning the people rejected from entry into the US under Title 42 could return and try again without any consequence. During the Trump administration under Title 42, [83%](https://cis.org/Arthur/Congressional-Budget-Office-Estimates-860K-GotAways-FY-2023) of encounters with border enforcement resulted in expulsion. Though President Biden continued to expel people under Title 42, he expelled a much lower percentage of encounters, with most encounters under Biden resulting in referral for evaluation of the alien’s claim and “humanitarian parole” into the US.\\[1]\n* As of late 2023, [nearly one million people](https://immigrationforum.org/article/explainer-asylum-backlogs) were awaiting review of their asylum claims, causing an enormous immigration hearing [backlog](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/media/1344851/dl?inline). Because there wasn’t space in existing detention facilities, rather than build new detention facilities (which Democrats first declined to fund, then Trump blew up a bipartisan funding deal), the Biden administration released asylum applicants into the US on “humanitarian parole” to await their asylum determination hearing, which takes on average between four and six years. This created a system where people had built lives— married US citizens, gone to college, had kids— all before losing their asylum case and being referred for deportation.\n\nWhile awaiting their determination hearings, asylum applicants are typically instructed to appear at regular check-ins with USCIS wherever they live. It is difficult to parse what percent of asylum applicants, specifically, fulfill that obligation. The second Trump administration has, en masse, reversed humanitarian parole without regard for the legitimacy of individual applications, forcing applicants to choose between detention in terrible conditions until their asylum application is heard or self-deportation. Given those options, even people with legitimate asylum claims may choose self-deportation. This is a very good reason for ICE to build many more detention centers and I’m glad that those have finally been funded, even as I dislike the culture that the second Trump administration is building in ICE and that they’ve seemingly completely abandoned prioritizing the deportation of criminals, instead prioritizing the deportation of [as many people as possible](https://tracreports.org/whatsnew/email.250801.html?).\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Asylum is for people experiencing a specific and credible fear of persecution in their home countries, not a fast-track for people from poor countries to build better lives in the US.\n* Asylum claims used to make up a small percentage of overall immigration, and applicants were mostly held in detention within the United States until their claims were adjudicated.\n* Under Democratic presidents, most asylum applicants have been permitted to live and work in the US while awaiting their immigration hearing (which takes 4-6 years on average!) to determine whether their asylum application will succeed. These applicants’ deportations were then deprioritized because they weren’t considered threats, creating a de facto alternative legal immigration scheme.\n* Asylum claims have skyrocketed to a rate that is impossible to process, creating:\n  * Heartbreaking stories where someone has built a whole new life in the US before being referred for deportation,\n  * A need for more detention centers so that detention centers are safe, humane spaces, and so that illegitimate asylum applications aren’t incentivized by the likelihood of long-term residency,\n  * A need for more immigration judges so that immigration determinations can be made more quickly.\n    * As asylum applications have cratered under Trump 2, anecdotally, the speed at which USCIS reviews applications for legal residency has dramatically increased. This is helpful to legal immigrants following a standard visa path.\n\nThe asylum process has been broken by allowing applicants to live and work in the US while awaiting a determination, a practice that itself leads to increased wait times that perpetuate the problem.\n\nThe second Trump administration has broken faith with recipients of humanitarian parole by reversing their parole arbitrarily, even though each case was granted individually, arresting them at their required check-ins, and focusing on the volume of deportations instead of on finding and deporting criminal aliens.\n\nNo one is acting in good faith on asylum, and the brokenness of the asylum system points to the need for holistic change to our immigration system, not just returning to the permissiveness of the Biden Administration.\n\n***\n\n[1] <https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R47556.html>?",
