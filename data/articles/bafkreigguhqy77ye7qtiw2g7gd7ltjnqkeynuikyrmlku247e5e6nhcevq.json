Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\n[By Crawford Anderson](https://www.awmfinancial.net/) and Sam Medlin\n\nAs a young man in a world that so easily entangles and encourages an apathetic, comfortable life, it feels nearly impossible to live set apart and be a man of God, as Scripture calls us to do. In fact, on my own, it is impossible. Alone, I will fail.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VHsM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e096b68-e7a4-49e3-ba9f-5ecc2a0e712d_1536x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VHsM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e096b68-e7a4-49e3-ba9f-5ecc2a0e712d_1536x1024.png)\n\nWhile I lean on the Lord and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, I must be part of a brotherhood that strengthens me and encourages me. As a young man striving for Christlikeness, I must intentionally build a community centered on accountability, honesty, and testimony. Only through this kind of community can deeper connections be formed, and can we run the race of discipleship together with fellow brothers in the faith.\n\nDuring my junior and senior years of high school, I was part of a biweekly men’s group called Iron Leadership. Around seventy of us met every other Friday morning to hear Scripture-centered teaching from the pastor of the hosting church. We then broke into small groups to share our takeaways over a homemade breakfast.\n\nDuring that same season, I also attended a men’s purity group on Saturday mornings at my church, connecting with a smaller group of men who were intentionally pursuing a pure, godly lifestyle and seeking accountability from each other.\n\nToday, I attend a Tuesday night Bible study on campus where we read through Scripture, chapter by chapter, and discuss it together. We combine our experiences and perspectives, supporting and sharpening one another as we grow in faith.\n\n**Ezekiel 33:7 (NIV)**\n\n_“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.”_\n\nRecently, multiple conversations with friends in my campus ministry have placed a conviction on my heart: the need to build a deeper brotherhood among young men in the faith. From that conviction, I am forming a small group currently called The Watchmen, drawing inspiration from Ezekiel 33:7 (NIV). The goal is simple: to sharpen one another, as iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17, NIV), and to build each other up in Christ.\n\n**Ecclesiastes 4:12 (NIV)**\n\n_“Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.”_\n\nFor this to work, honesty must be prioritized. Being profoundly open with one another is the only way to grow relationships that are truly deep and impactful, and Christ must remain at the center of everything we do. As Ecclesiastes 4:12 (NIV) reminds us, a cord of three strands is not easily broken. We are not meant to stand alone.\n\nWe will meet on Saturday mornings from 9 to 10. While this is not the most convenient time, that is intentional. This is not a group meant for lighthearted participation. This is serious. As men, we are called to lead in our communities and in our faith. Our future spouses, our children, and the ministries we are part of now and in the future will depend on our willingness to lead by example. We cannot afford to remain apathetic.\n\nWe must take this seriously enough to be mistaken for zealotry. That sounds excessive. Maybe it even sounds insane. But I am not afraid of being misunderstood or mocked, because this is a deadly serious issue. Brotherhood, accountability, and spiritual formation are not optional matters. They determine the kind of men we become.\n\nWe must band together. We must be strong together. And we must approach this with the gravity it deserves. My future wife, my future children, and my community are counting on me to be a man of God and to lead spiritually with humility, conviction, and consistency. That responsibility does not begin when those roles appear in my life. It begins now.\n\nWeek one will focus on why this group exists. I will share my testimony honestly, including my struggles and where I am coming from, and I will reflect on my experiences in various men-focused ministries. Together, we will read through Ecclesiastes 4 to establish a foundation and shared understanding of brotherhood.\n\n**James 5:16 (NIV)**\n\n_“Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.”_\n\nWeek two will center on James 5, discussing how truth and honesty form the bedrock of genuine brotherhood and connection. I anticipate sharing more of my testimony and inviting others to do the same.\n\n**Hebrews 3:13 (NIV)**\n\n_“But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called ‘Today,’ so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.”_\n\nWeek three will focus on Hebrews 3, emphasizing that consistency is essential to spiritual growth. Without consistently meeting, praying, and spending time in Scripture, we will never advance in our faith or in our calling. Faithfulness requires discipline.\n\nWeek four will cover Proverbs 27, addressing ownership within the group and our broader community, and developing a genuine interest in one another’s lives.\n\nThere is a real possibility that this group remains small, perhaps even discouragingly so. But that does not matter. I am committing to this. I am committing to serve humbly, to lead by example, and to trust the Lord to provide wisdom, direction, and fruit in His time.\n\nThere is no more time to waste. I cannot simply keep talking about change. I must act on what I believe is right and join the spiritual fight now.\n\n_I am praying daily for discernment and my fellow brothers in the faith as we are attacked by temptation. We must turn toward the Lord and lean on each other, not on our flawed decision-making._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
