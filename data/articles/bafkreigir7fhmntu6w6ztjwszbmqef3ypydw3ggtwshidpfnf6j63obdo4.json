  "body": "Jonathan Rauch’s Cross Purposes tackles an unusual topic for a self-described atheist, Jew, and homosexual: How “thicker” traditional Christianity can restore Americans’ commitment to pluralism and tolerance. He opens with an apology for “The Dumbest Thing I Ever Wrote,” acknowledging that his 2003 celebration of “apatheism” (apathetic atheism) was misguided. Instead of the “major civilizational advance” (Page 4) he had anticipated, Rauch recognizes that absence of religious affiliation has resulted in society, “import\\[ing] religious zeal into secular politics and export\\[ing] politics into religion, bringing partisan polarization and animosity to levels unseen since the Civil War.” (Pages 4 - 5) He surprises himself with the realization that “\\[I]n American civic life, Christianity is a load-bearing wall.” (Page 35)\n\nFrom this surprising warmth for Christianity, Rauch writes toward two points:\n\nFirst, to persuade that Christianity and Constitutional Pluralism need each other.\n\nTogether, he says they address “Four M’s” (Page 22):\n\n“_Mortality_: How can life have meaning if all it leads to, ultimately, is death?”\n\n_Morality_: What is the ultimate basis for belief in, and understanding of, right and wrong?”\n\n_Murder_: Why is the world so full of suffering, injustice, and violence?”\n\n_Miracles_: How can we explain the world without recourse to magic– thus reliably, systematically, and adjudicably?”\n\nRauch believes Christianity provides answers for morality and mortality that science and liberalism cannot reach. He believes science and liberalism provide answers for murder and miracles that Christianity cannot reach. Thus, Christianity and liberal democracy need each other– they need Constitutional Pluralism. Moderate Christianity (what he calls “Thin Christianity”) is rapidly losing congregants, so he turns to the Latter-Day Saints for lessons in congregant retention.\n\nSecondly, Rauch is concerned about “Sharp Christianity: The Church of Fear.” I share his fear, having grown up a homeschooled evangelical. As a kid, I identified with a movement of Christian homeschoolers called “Generation Joshua.” My peers all read the book Do Hard Things by then-teenaged brothers Alex & Brett Harris and committed to defying people’s low expectations. My upbringing’s theme through the early 00’s was that others’ stereotypes and expectations didn’t define you or your achievements and that fear shouldn’t stop you. I devoured Voice of the Martyrs books and magazines about the persecuted international Church. In AWANA, a national, weekly K-12 church program promoting Bible memorization, we memorized:\n\nPhilippians 4:12-13 NASB\n\nI know how to get along with little, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.\n\nWe separated from secular society, recognizing that we were a “peculiar” people. I watched the Church of Fear emerge from fundamentalist legalism and among non-Christians looking to gain power not over fear but over other Americans. From the braggadocio of men who promised they’d die to protect their wives but couldn’t bring themselves to wash dishes for her to people who proclaimed care for their neighbors but were too afraid to walk with them outside unmasked, I worried about the increasing unmooring of Americans from each other and from real adherence to the faith they claimed.\n\nNoticing self-proclaimed Christians unmoored from Christianity, Rauch quotes Andrew L. Whitehead and Samuel L. Perry in Taking Back America for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States, “Christian nationalism often influences Americans’ opinions and behaviors in the _exact opposite direction_ than traditional religious commitment does.” In other words, “sharp Christianity” does not imitate Jesus, and promotes panic and vengeance, leading to a collision with instead of support for America’s pluralistic Constitutional tradition. I agree heartily with this along with the proposed solution (though I’d order them differently): “Don’t be afraid. Imitate Jesus. Forgive each other.”\n\n“Thick Christianity,” he argues, is best practiced by the Latter-Day Saints, who maintain their global membership numbers even though of all the religions he discusses, their time and learning commitment is greatest. Members are assigned brothers and sisters to support them and provide accountability checks on their family teaching. From childhood through adulthood, members are expected to spend many hours a week learning about their faith and fellowshipping with other LDS members. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints even has churches, called wards, specifically designed to promote single LDS members inter-marrying. Rauch also discusses LDS teachings, which are unique from other Christian religions, including teaching compromise and negotiation as moral ends and teaching that the Constitution is a divinely inspired document. I found both agreement and stark disagreement in this section of Cross Purposes.\n\nAs an atheist, Rauch perceives the theological differences between Latter-Day Saints, Catholics, and Protestants as mere interesting variations of storytelling. Consequently, he tries to convince a Baptist pastor that The Fall (Adam and Eve’s fall into sin described in the Bible in Genesis 3) was actually good and treats Latter-Day Saints' sacred view of the Constitution as though it’s something from which evangelicals could learn instead of something from which evangelicals (and all other traditional Christians) would recoil as a matter of core doctrine. He also misses two finer points of disagreement, one between Catholics and Protestants and one among Christians, both of which would have signaled his comparison between Christianity and Latter-Day Saints was going to fail to persuade Christians had he recognized the conflicts. With just one throwaway line noting that he’s aware “some Christians” do not believe Latter-Day Saints are Christians, he fails to apprehend the seriousness of discrepancies between traditional Christian and Latter-Day Saints’ theology. Among other conflicts, unlike Latter-Day Saints, traditional Christianity does not teach compromise as a value, nor will a two-thousand-year-old faith with a history intertwining with even older Judaism accept the claim that a mere 250-year-old document written by Christians and non-Christians alike could be divinely inspired. That’s not to say, however, that Rauch lost me at the end of the book.\n\nRauch correctly notes that, “too many secular Americans… see accommodating faith as a zero-sum game in which religion’s gain is equality’s loss.” While he did not persuade me that Christians should make compromise a theological commitment, his argument for compromise as a process beneficial to the legal protection and national trust of minoritarian faiths versus compromise as its own end mirrors the approach of Braver Politics. “While it can sometimes be mere difference-splitting, compromise is more often a creative, generative, pro-social endeavor in its own right. If the parties in a disagreement deadlock, they gather more information, bring in new factions and voices, imagine innovations and workarounds. The result is often better than what anyone started with.” Also, he adds, “Simply by having to interact and do business, the parties to a negotiation develop the civic habits of peaceful coexistence and unlearn the habits of domination and distrust.” Sometimes, the process of compromise ends without one, having innovated a solution that “de-escalates the tensions which tear the fabric of pluralism” without needing to change what is acceptable to you. Even though Christians do not pursue compromise for the sake of morality, Christians should still notice that “in a diverse country full of moral disagreement, a disposition toward ‘patience, negotiation, and mutual accommodation’ is a win-win proposition.”\n\nHe closes with what I believe is the best argument for embracing traditional Christianity. Followers of Jesus are not commanded to take over the government for the ‘common good’ and force everyone to live Christian lives. Instead, we are to demonstrate lives that are a “living and holy sacrifice” conforming not to this world, “but being transformed by the renewing of the mind so that you may prove what the will of God is…” (Romans 12:1-2 NASB). It is this sacrificial living without fear, transformed through faith in Christ, that makes the biggest impact on Rauch. Visiting his close friend, a Catholic Bishop close to death from ALS, Jonathan Rauch “most acutely felt \\[his] own shallowness and spiritual poverty.” Seeing his friend’s lack of anger, “\\[he] tried to shelve \\[his] own.” His friend Mark’s “courage and grace amid an unbearable ordeal” was “a more powerful witness on behalf of the Christian faith than any words or argument could have borne.”\n\nThick Christianity, though some adherents would invalidate his own marriage, Rauch concludes, imitates Christ’s life and James Madison’s political engagement, and is necessary to sustain a pluralistic Constitutional society. Christianity, he believes, needs Constitutional pluralism to address humanity’s need to explain “Murder and Miracles” in the same way Constitutional Pluralism needs Christianity to explain “Mortality and Morality.” Christians who imitate Christ: praying for those who persecute them, forgiving those who wrong them, and fearlessly carrying their gear the extra mile (Matthew 5:41) are good for American culture and should be warmly welcomed even by atheists.\n\n**Housekeeping on this piece:\nCorrection:** LdS use the term “divinely-inspired” more broadly than I than I knew and we share a view of the Constitution as a document through which God has worked in America.\n\n_Additional Note:_ I’ve been made aware that some Latter-day Saints felt that my recent newsletter reviewing Jonathan Rauch’s book Cross Purposes was critical of their peacemaking work, which I believe to be excellent and vital. That was not my intent.",
