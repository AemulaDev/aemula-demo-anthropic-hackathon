  "body": "In June of 2024 I got [an op-ed in The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4731355-elon-musk-is-making-political-debate-more-toxic-heres-how-to-change-course/) about Elon Musk’s polarization — specifically his _affective polarization_: his extremely negative views of his political opponents and the high-contempt ways in which he engages across disagreement. With Trump’s election and Elon getting a lot more attention, I thought I’d make a podcast episode about that topic. That video is here:\n\n{{youtube:\\_rAtXw30Zbg}}\n\nThe truth is that many of us behave in high-contempt ways these days when it comes to our political divides. And the more divided we become, the more influence is given to people who take high-contempt approaches — and the more those people in turn influence our discourse to be more toxic. It’s a complex and self-reinforcing cycle: everything is connected.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LHqj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d8fb4c1-f70a-4e53-b9bf-4d60212e6f48_1562x938.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LHqj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d8fb4c1-f70a-4e53-b9bf-4d60212e6f48_1562x938.png)\n\nThe entry for this Elon Musk episode is here: <https://behavior-podcast.com/elon-musks-polarization-examining-his-contemptuous-approaches-to-political-disagreement>.
