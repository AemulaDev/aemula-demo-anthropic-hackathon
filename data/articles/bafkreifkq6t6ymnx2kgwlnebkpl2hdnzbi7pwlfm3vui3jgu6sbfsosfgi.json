  "body": "This morning, The Supreme Court dropped [Alexander, President of the South Carolina Senate, et al v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP et al](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-807_3e04.pdf)_._ The end of the SCOTUS term has always been like nerd Christmas for me but this year, I’ve been busy enough with my full-time work that I haven’t had time to read every decision the way I have in some years.\n\nTonight, I started listening to [Advisory Opinions](https://thedispatch.com/podcast/advisoryopinions/) most recent episode, which covered this case. 44 minutes in, I screamed. I didn’t even finish the podcast. I hit pause and pulled up Justice Thomas’s concurrence to Justice Alito’s majority opinion, because in complaining about South Carolina’s NAACP dual stereotyping: that the “candidate of choice” of Black voters there **can only** be a Black Democrat and any other outcome is indicative of racial gerrymandering, he also mentioned a _**very familiar Washington state case!**_\n\nFrom Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurrenc3\\[1]:\n\n> Such stereotyping is, of course, not limited to this case or black voters. For example, a District Court recently concluded that Hispanic voters in a majority-Hispanic district lacked an opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice, even though the district elected a Hispanic Republican. Soto Palmer v. Hobbs, \\_\\_\\_ F. Supp. 3d \\_\\_\\_, 2023 WL 5125390, \\*5, \\*9, \\*12 (WD Wash., Aug. 10, 2023). The court later purported to correct the lack of Hispanic opportunity by imposing a remedial map that made the district “substantially more Democratic,” but slightly less Hispanic. Soto Palmer, 2024 WL 1138939, \\*2, \\*5 (Mar. 15, 2024). In short, the court concluded that securing the rights of Hispanic voters required replacing some of those voters with non-Hispanic Democrats. That dismissive attitude toward non-Democratic members of minority groups exemplifies the tendency of the Court’s race-obsessed jurisprudence to “balkanize us into competing racial factions.” Shaw, 509 U. S., at 657. **The Court should correct course now before it inflicts further damage.**\n\nThe bolding is my own.\n\nSoto Palmer v. Hobbs is currently up for appeal at the 9th Circuit; this is excellent timing. I look forward to seeing this case granted certiorari in a future SCOTUS term!\n\n***\n\n\\[1] “602 U.
