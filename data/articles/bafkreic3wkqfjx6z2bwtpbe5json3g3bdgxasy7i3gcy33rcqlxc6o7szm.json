  "body": "Like many who are reading on Substack, I have read this article by Katie Jgln about how one of her articles was plagiarized by Maalvika:\n\n[Mama, There's a Plagiarist Behind You - The Noösphere](https://thenoosphere.substack.com/p/mama-theres-a-plagiarist-behind-you)\n\nWhen I read the article, I was outraged and saddened by what had been done to Katie, and I have been a bit troubled about this, as this incident has made me seriously question two things I firmly believed:\n\n1. Substack is a great place for writers to share their work.\n\n2. Long-form writing is strong evidence that people are thinking deeply.\n\nI still believe both to be true for the most part, but the fact that plagiarists (who are guilty of both fraud and theft) can be successful has made me think that the above two beliefs need to be qualified, especially the second one.\n\nSubstack is still one of the best places for writers to share their work. The community is still quite excellent, and even Substack Notes is more thoughtful than most comparable social media platforms. But Substack has significant room for improvement; plagiarists should not be able to become bestsellers.\n\nLong-form writing is still generally evidence of deep thinking, _but only when the writing originates with the writer publishing the work_. The plagiarist has not shown understanding of the content they have taken credit for; they have demonstrated only knowledge of how to copy and paste that content into a new article.\n\nSince the above article was published, I have been ruminating over how plagiarism can not only be addressed after the fact, but also how it can be made more costly and risky to carry out in the first place. There are no perfect solutions, but having deterrents in place can make plagiarism less attractive. Below are a few such ideas:\n\n### 1. Disable user selection of text by default\n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier Note, text in an article on Substack should not be selectable by default. People who share content should be able to turn this back on, but by default, text should not be selectable for copying and pasting. This may not prevent more sophisticated approaches to copying content, but making it harder to copy and paste would force the plagiarists to be more creative.\n\n### 2. Use AI tools to compare new articles with existing ones\n\nPlagiarists are likely using AI to assist them in taking unethical shortcuts, but those same tools can be used to detect duplicate content. If duplicate content is detected, Substack could then prevent the article from being published until the duplicate content is removed or place a disclaimer at the beginning of the article indicating that the article contains duplicate content, along with a link to the original content.\n\n### 3. Hard questions\n\nIt stands to reason that people who put in the hard work of writing the original article are going to be more fluent with the subject matter than someone who merely copied the article. This suggests to me that we might want to consider asking hard questions of people who post articles, and also think about how we might answer hard questions that are asked of us.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nWe have a great community here on Substack, and I find many of the articles and discussions to be thought-provoking. However, plagiarism destroys trust within this community and causes people not to get the credit they deserve for their work. Let’s honor the efforts of those who truly add something of value to the community.",
