  "body": "Ever since Congress, during its momentous post-Watergate era, amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, courts have heard numerous challenges to it. New laws are well-intended, but they don’t always work out that way. The framers of our Constitution were very wise to make the enactment of statutes very challenging, if only for this reason. During the 118th Congress (2023-2024), 274 bills were enacted out of nearly 11,000 introduced, and that’s not counting resolutions, joint resolutions, concurrent resolutions, and amendments.\n\nGiven the partisan makeup and behavior of the last Congress and White House, we should be _grateful_ they didn’t pass more laws.\n\n{{youtube:men-vp5jvzI}}\n\nThe Federal Election Campaign Act and its amendments have dramatically altered the relationship between money, voters, and the candidates they elect, and not always in positive ways. The law placed limits on both campaign contributions and expenditures and required the public disclosure of both. It placed limits on so-called “independent expenditures,” and further established a Federal Election Commission (FEC) whose members were appointed by Congress. It created a system of public funding for presidential campaigns, funded by a voluntary “check off” on your income tax returns. Making contributions by cash was and remains [strictly limited to $100 from a particular source](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/), and today, it is virtually unheard of. No candidate wants to be caught accepting _any amount_ of cash. I’ve never knowingly worked for a campaign that accepted cash contributions.\n\nA court challenge led by U.S. Senator James Buckley (R-NY) resulted in some provisions being declared unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds, including limits on independent expenditures and the congressional appointment of members to the FEC (which now requires presidential nomination). It also struck down limits on campaign expenditures. In subsequent decisions over the years, the Supreme Court also eliminated the aggregate limit on how much any individual may contribute to federal political campaigns (in the US House and Senate) in the case of _[McCutcheon v. FEC](https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/court-cases/mccutcheon-et-al-v-fec/)._\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IxX_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feca78156-569b-4ead-b79a-c3d88e0c11fd_681x383.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IxX_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feca78156-569b-4ead-b79a-c3d88e0c11fd_681x383.webp)\n\nBut Congress didn’t create one prominent element of federal campaign election law; instead, it was _established by the courts_, “[coordinated expenditures](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements-political-party/coordinated-party-expenditures/coordinated-party-expenditure-limits/).” That’s money that the national party committee is allowed to spend in coordination with their House or Senate candidates, on top of the cash ($5,000 per national party committee) they’re allowed to contribute for each election. The coordinated spending limits are based on the voting-age population of each state, ranging from approximately $127,000 for Wyoming to more than $3.9 million for California. Most US House districts get $63,600 (but double that for “single-member” states like Delaware and North Dakota).\n\nNational party committees are not required to spend that money, but the most competitive campaigns almost always get the full amount. Worse, due to individual and other contribution limits, we’ve turned Members of Congress into almost full-time fundraising machines.\n\nBefore the 1971 law was passed, there were practically no limits on what parties could spend on behalf of their nominees. Parties had a lot more power back then. They often controlled who ran, and official party support was tantamount to winning. The vast majority of contributions were made by cash, and lots of it, especially if you were a powerful incumbent.\n\nAs a result, in part, party discipline was more “common” in Congress. Today, thanks to those 1971 and 1974 laws (and subsequent court decisions), the vacuum created by strict limits on what parties can do has been filled by special-interest “super PACs,” Political Action Committees, and other well-organized entities, ranging from Planned Parenthood and its allies to the National Rifle Association. Candidates today have no problem bucking their leadership when it suits their special interests, creating numerous challenges for today’s congressional leaders.\n\nIn the past, Members of Congress also spent more time legislating and a lot less time on political fundraising. That has flipped.\n\nToday, we have elected officials more accountable to their coalition of special interest groups and national grassroots organizations than to their own party leadership in Washington. The Supreme Court, thanks to _NRSC v. FEC_, might rebalance that relationship.\n\nI’m not proposing a return to the campaign laws of yesteryear. They were vague and rarely enforced. Back in the day, envelopes containing campaign cash were regularly exchanged on the House and Senate floors. After he died, [$41,000 in campaign cash](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/27/archives/bobby-baker-he-made-at-least-one-two-many-bargains.html) was found in the late US Sen. Robert Kerr’s (D-OK) safety deposit box. Former President Richard Nixon tells the story of how his then-House colleague and future presidential opponent, John F. Kennedy, dropped by to [make a $1,000 cash contribution to Nixon’s 1950 Senate campaign](https://youtube.com/shorts/TkI5fKvf0fE?si=JU1j66rIt1vrKsja) on behalf of his father, Joseph Kennedy. The exchange happened in Nixon’s congressional office, an absolute no-no today. Go to the 3-minute mark of the following video, if it’s not queued up.\n\n{{youtube:d2Zsk9FGhEo}}\n\nMembers of Congress are _so careful_ today (or, _should be_) that they almost always keep two separate phones with them at all times - their “official” one, and another for the campaign. And they won’t talk to the media about their campaigns if the interview is conducted inside a public building. They can’t use public resources for political purposes, even by sharing their campaign website.\n\nWhich brings us to two Supreme Court cases that are likely to be decided by the time their term ends next July and may change the relationship between political parties and candidates (_[NRSC v. FEC](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-621/333312/20241204134722325_NRSC%20v.%20FEC%20Cert%20Petition.pdf)_), and the counting of mail ballots (_[Bost v. Illinois Board of](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-568/332166/20241119111610479_241110a%20Petition%20for%20efiling.pdf)_ _Elections_) received and counted after election day (14 days in the case of Illinois).\n\nThe NRSC (National Republican Senatorial Committee, one of the three official GOP national party committees) v. FEC case is scheduled to be heard on [December 9th](https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/24-00621qp.pdf). The case of US Rep. Michael Bost (R-IL) v. the Illinois State Board of Elections, which was conducted this month, deals specifically with whether Bost has “standing” to challenge Illinois’ “law” that permits ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after election day, on the presumption they’re postmarked by election day. If Bost gets “standing,” that is.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X9QB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f4af1bd-f402-4169-801e-6aaf0c47fe15_4032x3024.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X9QB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f4af1bd-f402-4169-801e-6aaf0c47fe15_4032x3024.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Lawyer and former US Solicitor General Paul Clement, with client US Rep. Michael Bost (R-IL) and Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, which filed the initial petition in support of Bost. They’re standing in front of the US Supreme Court.}}\n\nBost, represented by legendary Supreme Court lawyer [Paul Clement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clement), argued masterfully before the Court this week. [Scotusblog.com](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/10/justices-seem-willing-to-allow-candidate-to-challenge-elections-law-on-mail-in-ballots/) writer Evan Lee thinks that there may be as many as seven votes to grant Bost standing, which may set the stage for SCOTUS declaring Illinois and other states (_looking at you, Pennsylvania_) that keep counting ballots after election day _unconstitutional_.\n\n> At Wednesday’s **[argument](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-568_7l48.pdf)** in _**[Bost v. Illinois Board of Elections](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/bost-v-illinois-state-board-of-elections/)**_, not many of the justices worked hard to hide their cards. It appears there is a substantial majority, perhaps as many as seven justices, leaning toward reversing the lower federal courts’ holding that Rep. Michael Bost, a Republican member of Congress, lacked a legal right to sue, known as standing, to challenge an Illinois law allowing mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted even if they arrive as many as 14 days later. Perhaps the bigger mystery is what precise test for “standing” the court will adopt for election-law cases.\n\nI’m not a lawyer, so I apologize for any imprecision here regarding these two cases. However, “to have standing, a party must demonstrate a sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action being [challenged](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/challenge),” writes the [Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing) of Cornell University Law School. _That much is clear_.\n\nJosh Blackman, a conservative lawyer who writes for a favorite legal website, “The Volokh Conspiracy,” a feature of Libertarian-minded _[Reason Magazine](https://reason.com/volokh/2025/10/21/the-article-iii-of-the-deal-by-paul-clement/?nab=0\\&utm_source=Reason%2BMagazine\\&utm_campaign=5348bdaf73-reason_brand%7Cvolokh%7Cdaily\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_term=0_31d7ef7f57-5348bdaf73-588369711)_, wrote this:\n\n> As things turned out, Paul Clement, counsel for Bost, would present an entire menu of options for the Justices. These arguments were unlike anything I had seen before. There was an ongoing dialogue between Clement and the Justices about what test to adopt. Indeed, it seemed more like a mediation than an oral argument. A Justice would ask “What about this test?” and Clement would respond with “I could accept that, but I’d like something better.”\n>\n> Call it “The Article III of the Deal.” By the time Clement sat down, the case was basically over.\n\nIf you’re up to it, [read the oral arguments here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-568_f29g.pdf?utm_source=Reason+Magazine\\&utm_campaign=5348bdaf73-reason_brand%7Cvolokh%7Cdaily\\&utm_medium=email\\&utm_term=0_31d7ef7f57-5348bdaf73-588369711). Clement is _amazing_.\n\nBost’s petition was simple. His petition notes that Federal law sets the first Tuesday after the first Monday as Election Day. It further notes that several states, including Illinois, have enacted laws (or, in Pennsylvania’s case, judicial fiat during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic election) to count ballots received after Election Day.\n\nSome states require postmarks by election day, while other states, like Pennsylvania, _not so much_. As was noted by the left-leaning [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/what-if-mail-ballots-arrive-after-election-day-without-postmark) during the 2020 election, “At least 10 states (California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia) accept ballots with missing or illegible postmarks that arrive after Election Day.”\n\nAnd we wonder why [people lost confidence in our elections](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/12/38-of-americans-lack-confidence-in-election-fairness) following the 2020 elections. Some of that confidence has returned, but requiring all ballots to be received by election day and counted as soon as possible would significantly restore confidence in our elections and their results for everyone.\n\nAfter all, as the [Carter-Baker Commission](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/event/carter-baker-commission-16-years-later-voting-mail) following the controversial 2000 presidential elections surmised, “Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.” And voter fraud, whether Democrats admit it or not, [is a thing](https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/political-insider-explains-voter-fraud-with-mail-in-ballots/). They may influence elections at the margins, but there’s little doubt that it occurs.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DGSs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23062b6-f382-43cf-a3fc-1267f6db6e6a_1153x635.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DGSs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd23062b6-f382-43cf-a3fc-1267f6db6e6a_1153x635.png)\n\n{{caption:Courtesy of the Patriot Post, summarized from a 2020 story in the New York Post by Jon Levine. I have personal experience with opponents of candidates I’ve worked for who have used some of these tactics.}}\n\nFeel free to throw the “election denier” perjorative or “both sides” argument at me, as The Left™ always does after incidents of political violence. Still, as with political violence, the preponderance of vote fraud has a home in left field. A Google search of [indictments and convictions won’t take long to prove me correct](https://electionfraud.heritage.org/). Just ask yourself: why do blue states resist strong voter ID laws, especially cleaning up their voter rolls as required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (see Section Eight)? Red states have removed hundreds of thousands of ineligible voters from their rolls, but apparently not including the [recently-suspended Superintendent of Des Moines, Iowa, schools](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/school-chief-suspect-ice-arrest-des-moines-superintendent-exposes-fake-degrees-drug-convictions), an illegal immigrant who voted repeatedly in Maryland and the Hawkeye State.\n\n[![Split image of Des Moines school board meeting and Superintendent Ian Roberts.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fEIs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3073754-4447-4f55-82ef-7d0a03813b40_500x281.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fEIs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3073754-4447-4f55-82ef-7d0a03813b40_500x281.jpeg)\n\nEliminating the ability to receive and count votes—especially those without postmarks in places like Pennsylvania—after election day won’t completely eliminate this fraud, but it will disincentivize and minimize it by preventing corrupt operatives and officials from determining how many votes they need after election day to secure a “victory.”\n\nPlease spare me the arguments about accepting ballots after Election Day and how denying them disenfranchises voters. In 2014, my Pennsylvania ballot arrived late—it was required to be received by 5 p.m. on _the Friday before Election Day_. It arrived late, and it didn’t count. I knew the law, but I stupidly relied on the US Postal Service. Neither was my son’s ballot, who was working for my local congressman (a Republican) in Washington, DC, at the time—our _responsibility. Our bad._\n\nRep. Bost’s petition argues that counting ballots received after Election Day violates [Federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7) and the [Constitution’s Election](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-4/clause-1/congress-and-the-elections-clause) Clause, which establishes the first Tuesday after the First Monday in November as Election Day. Allowing Illinois and other states to count ballots impermissibly extends Election Day.\n\nThat’s why I’ve not voted by mail since 2016. I vote in person, either early or on election day. I cast my vote in Virginia’s elections on Monday, in person at my local senior center. We do a pretty good job of maintaining voter integrity in Virginia, even as our Voter ID laws remain too lax and election day registration is a potential source of fraud and mischief, especially in towns with local colleges that attract many out-of-state students.\n\nYou should ask yourselves why so many Democrats love voting by mail. When the USPS wanted to remove some of its boxes as a cost-cutting measure (it loses billions of dollars every year), Democratic congressmen like Peter DeFazio (D-OR, now retired) chained themselves to the boxes in protest.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0l1t!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf4d6aa9-c68b-4d62-9b0b-c8026ade8940_620x436.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0l1t!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf4d6aa9-c68b-4d62-9b0b-c8026ade8940_620x436.jpeg)\n\nI think we know why.\n\nThey’ll claim they’re all about voter access and making it easy to vote. I’m all for making it easy to vote, too, so long as it is also _harder to cheat_. Strong voter ID laws, which require presenting an official government photo ID that is not hard to obtain, along with following federal law on cleaning up voter rolls, will do most of the job. As a matter of policy, we should _encourage_ people to vote _in person_, either early or on Election Day. And all ballots MUST be received by the close of business on election day. I’m perfectly okay with starting to count mail ballots early on election day to expedite the process, as long as voters are notified when their mail ballots are received. If they didn’t cast a vote by mail, they should have the opportunity to challenge it.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TzsC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16ebc08-cc8c-47fc-833d-59facc07a76e_469x501.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TzsC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16ebc08-cc8c-47fc-833d-59facc07a76e_469x501.png)\n\nWe should ask why most European democracies don’t allow mail voting. Or, in some cases, voting early.\n\nAs a poll watcher in Pennsylvania’s Delaware County in 2020, I personally witnessed numerous voters showing up on Election Day, only to be told they had _already voted_. _That was news to them_. They were allowed to cast a provisional ballot as the matter was investigated. Pennsylvania is not exactly a “clean” state when it comes to elections. Especially as you get closer to Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nIf Rep. Bost gains standing to sue the Illinois Board of Elections, and I think he will, look for the issue of allowing ballots arriving after election day to be addressed by the Supreme Court in time for the 2026 elections (if the lower courts act fast enough, no guarantee), but no later than the 2028 elections. However, I’m eagerly awaiting the arguments in NRSC v. FEC. Eliminating the limits on “coordinated expenditures” would be a blow for free speech and would strengthen political parties' ability to support their candidates, as well as their leadership's ability to hold them accountable.\n\nAnd don’t tell me they’re accountable to you. Take a serious look at their FEC fundraising disclosures. That’s who they’re responsible to. I’d much rather exchange their accountability to special interests for their political party leaders and, by extension, to me.\n\nThat might make Congress work better. It sure can’t get any worse. _Or can it?_",
