One year into Trump’s return, the country feels less like a place with a government and more like a fever chart. Every week has its own spike — a constitutional crisis here, a demolition order there — until the chaos blurs into background noise and you begin to worry you’re numb. That might be the most dangerous damage of all.\n\nThe first months of this assessment confronted institutions we once believed were indestructible. The courts. The science agencies. The free press. All of them have been bent, starved, re-purposed. But there is a category of harm that cuts deeper than policy. It is the harm that rewrites who counts as one of us.\n\nYou can feel it if you stand long enough in towns like Nogales or McAllen. The air smells of bleach and metal. People speak differently now — quieter, clipped at the edges, as though sentences themselves have become risky. The question that used to live only on extremist message boards — who belongs here — is now federal policy.\n\nThat is where this chapter begins: not in a speech, not in a press release — but in a cell where a U.S. citizen sat for ten days while the government insisted he was not who he said he was.\n\nThe first thing they took from him was his name.\n\nIn the holding cell in Nogales, Arizona, the light hummed like a dying fluorescent and smelled faintly of rust and disinfectant. Jose Hermosillo, nineteen, born in New Mexico, sat on a metal bench, his hands tucked beneath his thighs for warmth. He repeated the same sentence over and over: I’m a U.S. citizen. The words sounded less like a claim and more like a prayer. Ten days would pass before a federal judge ordered ICE to release him, and his mother arrived with his birth certificate pressed against her chest like a talisman.¹\n\nThat humming light is not unique to Nogales. It is the signature of an immigration regime that now runs on suspicion, spectacle, and the performative humiliation of those it decides are outsiders. When the agents seized Hermosillo, they said he “looked foreign.” That was enough. The cell door closed, his name evaporated, and the government began speaking over him.\n\nIn 2019, before this second Trump era, another American boy sat in another cell. His name was Francisco Galicia — born in Texas, shackled by ICE for more than three weeks because officers decided his documents were “suspect.” He later said he considered signing deportation papers just to escape.² The terror of being forced to choose between physical freedom and national exile is something most Americans never imagine — until their government places them in that choice.\n\nWhen Trump launched his campaign in 2015, he did not begin with jobs or health care or foreign policy. He began by telling America that Mexico was sending “criminals” and “rapists” — “some,” he allowed, were good people.³ Even then, the crowd understood: they were being offered an enemy.\n\nEnemies simplify things. They absolve us of having to ask why the schools failed or why wages collapsed or why loneliness has carved its way through entire generations. If someone else is the enemy, then we are righteous.\n\nThat escalator speech hardened into law the moment Trump signed Executive Order 13769 — the Muslim ban — in January 2017.⁴ Airport terminals became holding sites, legal limbo zones. Mothers were told their children could not cross with them. Green-card holders were handcuffed. Translators wept in corners as husbands and wives waited on opposite sides of glass.\n\nThen came “zero tolerance.” Family separation. “As many children as possible,” internal discussions said, because trauma was the deterrent.⁵ We once imagined that America could commit harm only by accident. The record shows the policy was the harm.\n\nInside ICE field offices, spreadsheets began writing a different story. Non-criminal arrests doubled nationwide in early 2017.⁶ In Atlanta, the number skyrocketed fivefold in six weeks.⁷ Trump said the net was designed to catch the “worst criminals.” But the majority of people detained by ICE — then and now — have no criminal record at all. In 2019, that number was 64 percent. Today, it is nearly 74 percent.⁸\n\nThat hum returns, louder now, more structural — as if the entire system vibrates on a frequency tuned to fear.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office later found that between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 people, detained 121, and deported 70 who were “potential U.S. citizens.”⁹ The word potential is federal-speak for “we never bothered to check.”\n\nGalicia, asked later what frightened him most, did not mention food shortages or cold concrete or the sound of men trying not to cry. He said, “They told me I wasn’t who I said I was.”² When a government takes your identity and tries to hand you a new one, your passport becomes set dressing.\n\nIn Minnesota this year, Trump stood onstage and called Somali immigrants “garbage” who should be deported.¹⁰ In the audience sat a woman in a red scarf who later said to a reporter, “He is talking about my neighbors. My son’s teacher. Me.”\n\nThen — the voice that changed the oxygen in every room where it was uttered:\n\n\\*\\*_“Animals. That’s what I’ll always call them. Animals.”_\\*\\*¹¹\n\nTrump did not whisper that. He defended it on camera. It was not a slip. It was the ideology spoken plainly.\n\nStephen Miller, the policy architect who once circulated white-nationalist writings before advising the president,¹² now oversees an expanded playbook. His second-term vision is mass deportation powered by expedited removals, federal-state deputized policing, and the National Guard.¹³ It is all written down — there is no conspiracy to decode. It is called Project 2025, and its goal is demographic redesign.\n\nWe have been here before. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was justified by saying Chinese Americans, even those born here, “could not assimilate.” In 1942, Japanese American citizens were interned because citizenship, federal leaders said, “does not preclude loyalty to a foreign power.” Our history shows the slope is greased. The only question is whether we remember where it ends.\n\nThere is a death in this story too — because policies that treat human beings as variables eventually yield corpses. A Guatemalan farmworker named Francisco Gaspar-Andrés died this year in ICE custody after apparent medical neglect.¹⁴ His wife had already been deported. Their six-year-old daughter now sleeps with his work gloves. Soil still clings to the palms. They smell of onions and earth.\n\n\\*\\*_“He thought he could survive anything. He was wrong.”_\\*\\*¹⁴\n\nThat smell lingers as we step backward from the narrative and look at the shape of what is being built. Trump recently told a rally that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.”¹⁵ Those five words — blood, poison, country — belong to another century, a darker one. But here they are, in 2025, spoken beneath red, white, and blue bunting.\n\nThe question now is whether we treat this as spectacle or as a warning.\n\nIf the government can lock up an American teenager for ten days and insist he is someone else, then citizenship is already no longer a right — it is a permission slip, revocable at the pleasure of power.\n\nIf we allow policies to define neighbors as garbage and children as deterrence units, then the hum of fluorescent lights in detention cells becomes the soundtrack of our national identity.\n\nWe are only one year into this return. The damage is cumulative. And the window to stop it is shrinking.\n\nThe light continues to hum. It is ours to turn it off.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nBiibliography\n\n1\\.
