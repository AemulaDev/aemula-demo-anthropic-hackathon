Sooner or later, we all will disagree with others if we are being fully honest.\n\nAnd when we get online, we bring our contrary views with us, and disagree with others we meet online. We may or may not confront or debate them, but we don’t agree with what they are saying, either.\n\n### The survey\n\nI recently posted a question on Substack Notes related to online disagreements. It read as follows:\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!voLg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7e2ce73-aa2b-459f-b91b-17e9ad785c6e_1360x1360.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!voLg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7e2ce73-aa2b-459f-b91b-17e9ad785c6e_1360x1360.jpeg)\n\nI got a lot of interesting answers to this question; it has gotten more replies than any other Note I’ve posted that I’m aware of.\n\nI realized later that the way I framed the question may have prompted people to give the answers they did; everyone seemed to imagine the other party as being unreasonable to some extent, which is not always the case. Sometimes, we’re the unreasonable party, and sometimes there are no unreasonable parties.\n\nWith this framing, many of the answers given suggested that such conversations shouldn’t even be started. Various reasons were given for this, but people who responded this way considered that conversations of this kind were just not the best use of time and energy. While this approach is understandable, it has shortcomings which I will discuss shortly.\n\nA few people selected option C (the other party is not arguing in good faith), and I find myself leaning towards this answer when there are no better outcomes.\n\n### Pros and cons of avoiding online discussions\n\nSocial media is a vast ocean of opinion, and we would drown if we tried to resolve every disagreement. Additionally, we have bills to pay, and most of us don’t get paid to express our opinions online, which means we must prioritize some conversations over others.\n\nOur real lives take priority over our digital lives. Whatever we bring to the online table, we bring from our real-world selves. Spending too much time in online discussions is unhealthy.\n\nBut as I said earlier, if we are online, we will likely express ourselves online, including our views on various topics, and others who read our posts may not agree with us. Despite our best efforts, we will find ourselves in disagreement with others.\n\nSome of these issues are worth the effort to discuss online, and others are not. We have a responsibility to one another to represent each other’s views accurately and charitably, and we are going to be better prepared to do that if we engage in dialogue with them. Though I am not a fan of memes, I think [this one](https://ifunny.co/picture/being-taught-to-avoid-talking-about-politics-and-religion-has-vhnHE1m6B?s=cl) expresses the idea well.\n\nSo, before we need to know when to quit, we need to know when to start. And we should start when we have good reason to believe that there is common ground between us and the other party, and that a productive discussion is likely. We should express our position confidently, but we should also ask good questions to understand the other party’s position more clearly.\n\n### Isn’t it better to have face-to-face discussions?\n\nThere are certainly many advantages to having face-to-face discussions, but there are also disadvantages.\n\nIn a face-to-face discussion, all of the participants can see and hear each other and observe each other’s body language. This is a big advantage. It is good to be able to tell how others are reacting to what you are saying so that you can adjust what you are saying accordingly. Face-to-face discussions have other advantages as well: everyone who participates needs to be comfortable with the subject matter being discussed; using AI to help you is a bit more awkward in a face-to-face discussion. Most importantly, everyone involved in the discussion is human. No bots will be present in these discussions.\n\nOn the other hand, participants in a face-to-face discussion can be interrupted, and often are. This is rude, of course, but it happens all the time. Also, not everybody is guaranteed to have a chance to speak. If you don’t get your chance to speak, well…that’s too bad. Better luck next time. Additionally, a face-to-face discussion is a real-time event, with only brief delays of a few seconds between speakers. When discussing emotionally charged topics that are complex and nuanced, the non-verbal communication that might have been an asset under other circumstances could become a liability, especially when people are having to think on the fly. To use Daniel Kahneman’s terminology from _Thinking, Fast and Slow_, we often apply System 1 to a topic that properly requires a System 2 response, and we respond in ways that are often aimed at our opponents instead of their arguments.\n\nWritten communication is immune to interruptions and missed opportunities to contribute to a conversation. It also allows for delays between when one person shares their views and another person responds. This ability to delay my response has helped me craft a more thoughtful response in several situations. A friend of mine once shared a post on Facebook that explained why hymnals were better than having songs displayed on a screen at church. While his post was understandable and gave a fairly good argument for hymnals, I thought something was missing. I took the next day to think about what was missing, as well as how to express both points of agreement and disagreement. He and another friend of mine responded to me, and I think that it was a productive conversation that helped me learn things about my friends that I didn’t know before. Had I responded immediately, I’m not sure that the conversation would have been as positive.\n\n### Not all written communication is equal\n\nPlatforms that encourage short-form written communication (Twitter/X, Bluesky, Truth Social) are more conversational in nature, which makes them popular, but that “feature” also negates the advantages of written communication as described above. Instead of crafting a nuanced response that may or may not garner significant attention, we aim for a simple response that goes viral. Instead of properly representing others’ views, we caricature those views to make them easier to attack.\n\nFacebook is somewhat more conducive to long-form content, but Facebook, like the platforms listed in the previous paragraph, doesn’t really encourage the kind of written communication that has the advantages listed in the previous section. It doesn’t break up long-form content into smaller portions, but it is still somewhat difficult to consume long-form content on Facebook. As such, I frequently find that it is easier to take the path of least resistance and opt for short, quick responses rather than longer, more thoughtful ones.\n\nI have found Substack to be the best platform I have used thus far. It is far easier to write a long article that is formatted well and easy to read on Substack than it is on Facebook. This makes it easier to organize my thoughts and better structure my argument. Also, I can save a draft and return to it later if I so choose, which is a further advantage of written communication. When it comes to discussing complex and nuanced subjects online, Substack offers the best tools for the job.\n\n### Some people just want to fight\n\nNot everyone wants to learn or understand; there are many people out there who are, for one reason or another, unwilling to concede any ground or acknowledge good points made by their opponents. These people are not arguing in good faith; they want to “win” without regard for truth.\n\nIt may take some time to determine whether people are arguing in good faith, willing to change their minds, and willing to admit error. But once it becomes apparent that the other party is not arguing in good faith, it is a good time to end the conversation.\n\nNow, some may think that it is worth it to continue the conversation for the benefit of other participants. That may be the case, but it is not likely that this will produce good results that will be noticeable anytime soon. Also, persuasion is quite often a two-way street. Are you willing to risk having your convictions shaken to show those who are watching why you are right and your opponent is wrong?\n\n### Final thoughts\n\nNo matter whether we discuss ideas online or face-to-face, we should represent one another’s views accurately and charitably and ensure that everyone has the chance to be heard and understood. No one form of communication is perfect; each one has limitations that we should be aware of. But a right to be heard comes with a responsibility to discuss topics in good faith and be willing to change one’s mind when appropriate.\n\nLet’s aim to promote truth and understanding, and avoid unnecessary time spent in bad-faith arguments.",
