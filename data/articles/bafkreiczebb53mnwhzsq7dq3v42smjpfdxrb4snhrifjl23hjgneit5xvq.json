The path forward is clear, and the time to act is now. In this final section, we detail the immediate next steps and extend a heartfelt invitation for you-as funders, policymakers, deep thinkers, innovators, and champions of change-to support the Trust Foundation and join our catalytic community.\n\nWe have already established the initial governance team (a small steering group) and have been holding a series of regional roundtable meetings to expand our circle. These informal sessions bring together local invitees to introduce the catalytic community concept and gather input on trust challenges. The goal is to recruit additional partners and ensure that on-the-ground realities in different regions inform our plans.\n\nAs mentioned, a flagship multi-day gathering is planned for later this year in Washington, D.C. Preparations for this convening are underway. We are developing the agenda in collaboration with McChrystal Group to incorporate \"Team of Teams\"-style small group breakouts and exercises. This event will be a milestone where the founding members of the catalytic community come together, solidify the mission charter, and likely announce the first wave of task forces and pilot projects. We invite interested funders and policymakers to attend or observe this inaugural trust gathering. It will be an opportunity to see the community in action and even roll up your sleeves in the design process.\n\nWithin six months, we anticipate at least two to three task forces launching pilot initiatives (as discussed in earlier sections).\n\nWe will continue to reach out and bring in key voices. Help us connect! If you have networks in any sector that should be part of this, we welcome introductions. This could be an invitation to speak at a gathering of mayors, a connection to a coalition of philanthropies, or simply sharing this white paper with colleagues who care about rebuilding trust.\n\n## How You Can Support or Join Us\n\nWe seek funding partners for the Trust Foundation who share our vision. Contributions will be allocated toward convening costs, technology platforms, seed grants for community-led projects, and monitoring and evaluation to inform our efforts. We offer funders both collective investment opportunities (pooled funds for general support) and targeted sponsorships (supporting a specific component, such as a regional hub or a research fellowship on trust metrics). All contributions are tax-deductible and come with regular impact reports. By investing in this, you are leveraging a whole network of actors-it's a high \"return on society\" investment. For inquiries on funding, please get in touch with us at info@thetrustfoundation.org or visit our website: https://thetrustfoundation.org.\n\nNot all support is financial. We call on those with relevant expertise-such as facilitators, community organizers, data analysts, legal advisors, and technologists-to donate their time or skills. For instance, if you have design thinking facilitation skills, you could help run a breakout at a gathering. If you're a data scientist, help us develop the trust metrics dashboard. Policymakers could offer to mentor a task force working in their area of policy. There is a role for everyone. This truly is a coalition of the willing, with generous contributions from pro bono experts that will amplify our impact. We plan to establish a \"Trust Cloud\" of volunteers and pro bono contributors that we can deploy as needed-please let us know if you'd like to be part of it.\n\nIf the mission resonates and you want a seat at the table, consider joining the catalytic community. We are not an exclusive club; we are a growing commons. Whether you're an academic researching social trust, an entrepreneur building trust tech, a public servant, or a concerned citizen leader, there is a place for you in this network. As a member, you can participate in discussions, join (or lead) a task force, attend gatherings, and help shape strategy. Membership simply requires a commitment to our shared purpose and principles. We especially encourage cross-sector teams-if you come as a duo or trio from different backgrounds, ready to collaborate, even better.\n\nOur call to action is ultimately this: Join us in catalyzing a movement to restore trust. The Trust Foundation is committing our convening power, resources, and resolve to this endeavor, but we cannot do it alone-nor should we. The very thesis of this paper is that collaboration is the solution. We need you as partners, co-creators, and critical friends. If you have read this far, you clearly understand the stakes: societies crumble when trust is lost, and our generations must not pass on this legacy to the next.\n\nBy participating in this catalytic community, you choose to be part of the solution. You choose to work across divides, invest in relationships and innovation, and build a trusted network of thinkers, doers, and resource allocators. It is a proactive, hopeful stance in a cynical time.\n\nWe close with a powerful reminder that none of us can finish this work alone, but we can begin to turn the tide together. As the Integral Leadership Review noted, \"*If the next Buddha is a Sangha, then facilitative leaders will be its conveners.*\" We invite you to join us in convening to serve as a facilitator of collective healing. The time for siloed efforts is over; the time of the catalytic community has begun.\n\nLet's build this future of trust together. By joining the Trust Foundation's catalytic community, you become part of a growing collective effort to restore trust in our institutions, our information ecosystem, and among one another. The path is challenging, but the reward is nothing less than the renewal of the social fabric upon which our democracy, economy, and well-being depend.\n\nWe hope you will answer the call. Together, we rise as a catalytic community to combat the trust apocalypse-and to leave a legacy of a more trustworthy world.\n\nFor more information or to get involved, please get in touch with the Trust Foundation at [info@thetrustfoundation.org](mailto:info@thetrustfoundation.org). We look forward to partnering with you.\n\n***\n\n*To read more and support or subscribe directly, find all the Trust Apocalypse work on [Substack](https://trustapocalypse.substack.com/).*",
