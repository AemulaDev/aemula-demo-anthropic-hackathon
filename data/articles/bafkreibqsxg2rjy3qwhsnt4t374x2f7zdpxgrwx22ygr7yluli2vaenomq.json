Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nBenjamin Franklin once said, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” Or that was made up. I honestly don’t know. As we discussed last week in, _[Taxes Snowball Too!](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/taxes-snowball-too?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, letting your money compound and work for you so you don’t have to is the most reliable way to build long-term wealth.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to save without radically changing your lifestyle is by lowering costs like gas, groceries, or your phone bill. This week, we’re tackling your phone bill. It’s time to switch off T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT\\&T and find the lowest cost option that still meets your needs.\n\nFirst, my condolences. You have officially lost your free data plan, priority service, and 9G+ data speeds.\n\nThere are only three mobile data providers in the United States: Verizon, AT\\&T, and T-Mobile. All three are massive, hundred-billion-dollar companies that control all mobile bandwidth. But that doesn’t mean your only option is to buy directly from them. What you need is likely far cheaper than they’d have you believe.\n\nVerizon deliberately offers three tiers of unlimited plans to overwhelm you into picking the most expensive option, since it feels safer.\n\nWhat you are really paying for isn’t data. You are paying for “free” phone upgrades, smartwatch add-ons, hotspot perks, and bundled streaming services you likely don’t use or even realize you’re paying for.\n\nNow for the painful part. That premium carrier name at the top of your phone is going away. Welcome to the world of mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs.\n\nMVNOs are separate companies, often owned by or partnered with the Big Three, that rent network capacity and resell it at much lower prices. Same towers. Same coverage. Lower cost.\n\nI have personally used Mint Mobile and Visible, and both work well for my needs. Their customer service has never been bad for me, and I can’t recall any issues taking more than a few minutes to resolve by chat or phone.\n\nBefore we go deeper, a quick side note. Buying refurbished technology is one of the easiest ways to save hundreds of dollars. Most people don’t need the performance of the newest iPhone. Hate to break it to you, but an iPhone 13 still functions perfectly well as a phone.\n\nMy refurbished iPhone 13 was under $300, and it will easily last me another year before I upgrade, likely to another refurbished model. Paying double for a slightly better camera is not a wise financial decision.\n\nOne significant difference between the Big Three and MVNOs is how you pay. With MVNOs, you pay upfront for coverage. For example, Mint Mobile offers three, six, and twelve-month plans, with the best pricing on the longest-term plan. It benefits the company because they get paid sooner, and it benefits you because the monthly cost decreases the farther in advance you prepay.\n\nMint Mobile runs on T-Mobile’s network and is also owned by them. All plans include unlimited talk and text, with different tiers for data limits. Realistically, most people want unlimited data, but tracking your usage for a month isn’t a bad idea.\n\nLast year, I started on Mint’s 20 GB plan and upgraded halfway through the year. The switch was seamless. I just paid the difference.\n\nRight now, Mint is running a promotion where the first twelve months are 50% off. That means unlimited 5G data for about $180 per year, with no contract.\n\nVisible, my current provider, is owned by Verizon and runs on their network. Recently, I spent $255 for Visible, including taxes and fees, so about $22 per month. Their base plan is usually $25 per month or $275 per year, but I got a $20 off coupon. It also includes unlimited data and an unlimited hotspot capped at 5 Mbps. Not home internet, but perfect in a pinch.\n\nVisible is currently running a promotion where the plan is $19 per month for the first 26 months, or about $230 per year.\n\nSo why are these plans so much cheaper? First, there are no “free” phone upgrades. Second, you are deprioritized. That sounds scary until you realize it rarely matters.\n\nIn my experience, slowdowns occur only in extreme situations, such as a Boston RedSox game I attended last year, when tens of thousands of other users were present. That might be a good reminder to put your phone away and enjoy the moment anyway.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sFmp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F563e18fb-d57b-4c0a-a496-2978dc1da08f_491x989.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sFmp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F563e18fb-d57b-4c0a-a496-2978dc1da08f_491x989.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The interface for Visible, I’m on track to use over 40 GB this month!}}\n\nThird, you give up the prestige of a Big Three carrier name. Yes, seeing Visible or Mint instead of Verizon can bruise the ego. But for several hundred dollars per year, I’ll take that trade!\n\nFor comparison, Verizon’s cheapest unlimited plan starts at $55 per month for a single line. That is $660 per year, plus a $40 activation fee and late fees if you miss a payment. Their top plan can hit $100 per month before discounts.\n\nThose plans include bundles like Netflix or HBO Max with ads, but student discounts usually make them cheaper directly. Verizon also advertises three-year price locks. Sounds great until you realize mobile plans historically get more affordable over time, just like TVs and older phones.\n\nSwitching providers is easy, and it takes about 15 minutes. My strategy is to switch every year to take advantage of new-customer pricing. When my current plan expires, I will likely move back to Mint and lock in another year for $180. Compared to Verizon’s cheapest plan, that is $480 in annual savings. Invest that according to the [25-500 plan](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x), and that difference alone could grow to over $35,000 by retirement.\n\nSo please do yourself a favor, bite your tongue, and go with the weird Ryan Reynolds commercial with the weird fox guy, and save yourself a whole bundle of money. Yes, I’ll include my Visible referral [code](https://www.visible.com/get/?66MWNNV), so we can both save money.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
