  "body": "At 2024’s Washington State Republican Convention, I observed things that both horrified and fascinated me. Among those was the observation that populists or “woke right” as they’re now called, had clearly traded the value of Truth for the value of loyalty. Gone was the curiosity of the TEA Party activists, or the search for righteousness and Truth in politics among the Religious Right I had known and early in my life participated in, and replacing it was raucous support for lies in the right direction, casual commitment to distrust.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this and arrived at the conflict between loyalty and faithfulness. We say that we want political candidates who are “loyal” to America, to the American people, to the Constitution, and to the rule of law. That’s a mistake; what we should really want is faithfulness to those things. We want a faithful spouse. We want loyal friends.\n\nWhat’s the difference?\n\nLoyalty, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is “giving or showing **firm and constant support or allegiance** to a person or institution.” There’s no exception. It’s constant support, regardless of the action (or lack thereof) of a person or institution. Loyalty is unyieldingly supportive even when the object of loyalty is actually evil.\n\nFaithfulness, on the other hand, means “**following the facts or the original accurately.**” Even the second definition, marital faithfulness, is based on this definition— following the original promise you make in marriage— to forsake all others. Though these words have come to be treated as synonyms, unlike loyalty, faithfulness is not unyieldingly supportive. Faithfulness cares about Truth; loyalty ignores it.\n\nApplying this outside of politics: For all the great country songs about loyal girlfriends murdering violent husbands, no one should actually want a friend who will commit extrajudicial murder for them. We shouldn’t strive to be someone who would help their best friend bury a body. We should strive to be a friend willing to encourage and help their best friend escape an abusive relationship— legally. We should want friends who will tell us when we are wrong, who will refuse to support us when we suggest bad ideas.\n\nLikewise, in politics:\nWhat does it mean to be _loyal_ to the American people versus _faithful_ to the American people?\nLoyalty to the whims of the population means charting an unstable and unpredictable path. It means giving people what they want, even when that comes into conflict with the Constitution.\n\nLoyalty to the Constitution means being unable to consistently express complaints or disagreement with SCOTUS interpretations of the Constitution. It means that whatever is in the Constitution at a given time is the thing you care about obeying perfectly, rather than enduring principles that underlie the document.\n\nLoyalty to a political party (with its changing platforms) means caring about winning above anything else. It means subjecting your values, concerns, and principles to those expressed by the party. If you’re pro-life and the party isn’t, it means that you stop caring whether a candidate is pro-life. If you think rent control is bad and the party supports it, it means you stop caring whether your party promotes rent control.\n\nLoyalty requires constant support, **no matter what. Loyalty prohibits boundaries.**\n\n**If you cannot identify a boundary that could be crossed and cause you to remove your support from a person, party, or ideology, you might be loyal instead of faithful.**\n\nBeing faithful to the American people means seeking their long-term good— and refusing to act on destructive demands, even when those demands come from a majority.\n\nFaithfulness to the Constitution means seeking to **follow the original accurately**… even when it leads to outcomes you personally dislike.\n\nFaithfulness to political parties is a bad idea because parties’ beliefs change over time, and what candidates believe also varies widely.\n\n**Faithfulness requires knowing what is true and following it even when people you love oppose you or push you out of their bubble.**\n\nLoyalty does not love; loyalty manipulates and controls. It can look and sound golden, but in the end, it will break your friendships and leave you blue. Your worst enemies might be loyal for their own selfish ends.\n\nFaithfulness loves selflessly and honestly, following Truth instead of popularity or selfish desire. Loyalty pushes toward power and corruption.\n\nDesire faithfulness, not loyalty— in religion, politics, friendships, and throughout life.",
