  "body": "*This article was originally published to* [The Fulcrum](https://thefulcrum.us/ \"https://thefulcrum.us/\"), *a platform where insiders and outsiders to politics are informed, meet, talk, and act to repair our democracy and make it live and work in our everyday lives.*\n\n***\n\nMy connection to structural political reform is indirect. I run an organization, [More Like US](http://morelikeus.org/), aiming to change what Americans see and hear about each other across the political spectrum.\n\nI care about structural reform's ability to improve incentives that politicians face, so they less frequently and less harshly demonize political opponents.\n\nWhile I rarely refer to anything religious, I think of the [Serenity Prayer](https://www.beliefnet.com/prayers/protestant/addiction/serenity-prayer.aspx) in terms of today's “gerrymandering arms race.”\n\nI think the political structural reform field has to *accept the things (it largely) cannot change*. From my perspective, the field has little short-run ability to stop maximal gerrymandering. I see states with Republican trifectas in state government mostly maximizing their possible seats, and states with Democratic trifectas mostly doing the same, if sometimes in response. Only in the longer term might proportional representation be a solution.\n\nStill, the political structural reform field should have the *courage to change the things (it) can.* These can be beneficial, even if maximal gerrymandering becomes common. [Open primaries](https://openprimaries.org/) reduce incentives for politicians to placate their base and could scramble general elections. They are now less politically fraught than ranked-choice voting.\n\nI cannot fully claim to have the *wisdom to know the difference*. But I think More Like US's work can also help. Part of the underlying drive for gerrymandering is deep concern—or fear—about those in the other party. Yet [much](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hZmp2qCVkUb4zeC-BNyC7BNdv_3Mwz_c/edit#slide=id.g2f09cc7e969_0_112) [research](https://perceptiongap.us/) shows these fears of everyday Americans are overblown. If we [drain away the overblown threat](https://thefulcrum.us/bridging-common-ground/draining-authoritarian-government) of each other, the desire for gerrymandering should also decline.",
