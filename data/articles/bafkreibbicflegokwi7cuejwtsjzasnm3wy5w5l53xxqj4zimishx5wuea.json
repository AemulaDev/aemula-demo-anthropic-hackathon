Ink drying on a clause written in someone else’s language. The dull knock of a customs stamp. A calm voice explaining—reasonably, almost kindly—that this is simply how things will be arranged now.\n\nAmerican power has often arrived this way. Not with trumpets, but with paperwork.\n\nFrom the beginning, the United States developed a distinctive method of expansion. Outcomes were enforced through agreement rather than proclamation, dominance expressed through process rather than flag. Sovereignty was acknowledged in principle, reshaped in practice. The result was not classical empire, but something quieter and more durable: conditional sovereignty.\n\nThis is not a claim that American power has been uniform, illegitimate, or equally coercive across eras. The degree of consent, constraint, and benefit has varied widely. But the governing pattern—the preference for control without annexation—has been remarkably consistent.\n\nIn the early republic, expansion did not announce itself as conquest. It presented as inevitability. Treaties with Native nations were signed, revised, violated, and replaced with administrative regularity. Removal was framed as protection. Violence was reframed as order. By the time forced relocation hardened into federal policy, the underlying rule was clear: sovereignty existed until it interfered with American need. After that, it became negotiable.¹\n\nThis was not hypocrisy so much as habit. The United States learned early that power exercised through law felt cleaner than power exercised through decree—and more defensible to itself.\n\nThat habit shaped the nineteenth century. When President James K. Polk sent troops south in 1846, he did not describe war with Mexico as imperial ambition. He described it as response—a border incident, a provocation, a necessity. By the time U.S. forces occupied Mexico City, rhetoric no longer mattered. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo transferred nearly half of Mexico’s territory to the United States.² It was one of the largest land seizures in modern history, executed not as annexation but as transaction. Land exchanged for peace. Sovereignty converted into acreage.\n\nThe mechanism mattered. Power embedded in agreement carried less stigma and proved easier to normalize.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, American influence moved offshore. The Spanish–American War was framed as liberation. Spain fell. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and Guam. Cuba was declared independent—with conditions. The Platt Amendment granted Washington the right to intervene militarily, approve foreign treaties, and maintain permanent bases.³ Cuban sovereignty existed, but only inside boundaries drawn elsewhere.\n\nThe Philippines exposed the limits of that arrangement. Filipino nationalists who had fought Spain expected independence. Instead, they encountered a U.S. counterinsurgency campaign that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. American officers spoke openly of “civilizing” the population. Empire, when met with resistance, reverted to force.⁴ The lesson Washington drew was not that control was illegitimate, but that it needed refinement—and that visibility carried costs.\n\nRefinement arrived quickly, and often improvisationally.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the United States discovered it did not need to rule territory directly to control outcomes. It needed leverage points. The Panama Canal became the template. Washington backed Panama’s secession from Colombia in 1903, then secured permanent control over the Canal Zone.⁵ No annexation. No colonial administration. Just a strategic artery governed by treaty and Marines.\n\nThe Caribbean became a laboratory. Haiti. Nicaragua. The Dominican Republic. U.S. troops arrived to stabilize finances, protect creditors, and ensure order. In Haiti, American officials rewrote the constitution to permit foreign land ownership and took control of customs revenue.⁶ Sovereignty remained ceremonial; authority did not. These arrangements were not the product of a single doctrine so much as bureaucratic momentum—decisions layered atop decisions, institutions adapting to precedent.\n\nBy the Cold War, conditional sovereignty had hardened into a governing logic—but not an uncontested one.\n\nDirect occupation gave way to regime management. Iran in 1953. Guatemala in 1954. Democratically elected governments removed not because they were hostile, but because they threatened American strategic or economic interests. The word “imperial” rarely appeared. The word “stability” appeared constantly.⁷ Power flowed through intelligence services, military aid, and financial pressure. Outcomes were shaped. Formal independence remained intact. But these actions were debated internally, constrained by allies, and resisted domestically—evidence not of benevolence, but of friction within the system itself.\n\nVietnam was the moment this logic fractured publicly. The occupation was too large. The costs too visible. The war exposed the limits of conditional sovereignty when applied through force rather than consent. Policymakers did not agree on the lesson. Some concluded intervention had gone too far; others that it had been applied clumsily. What Washington absorbed institutionally was caution about scale and spectacle, not abandonment of influence.⁸\n\nAfter Vietnam, American power grew quieter.\n\nIn Latin America through the 1970s and 1980s, the United States supported authoritarian regimes so long as they aligned with American interests. Elections became optional. Human rights conditional. Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina. Sovereignty was respected in form, overridden in practice. Influence traveled through intelligence cooperation, arms transfers, and financial institutions.⁹ These arrangements were often accepted by local elites—and sometimes by populations exhausted by instability—because they promised order, growth, or protection against worse alternatives.\n\nAfter September 11, the language shifted again. Afghanistan and Iraq were not colonies. They were missions. But the structure was familiar: client governments, redesigned security forces, permanent bases, contractors replacing administrators. Political systems built under supervision. Withdrawal always promised, never decisive.¹⁰ Conditional sovereignty persisted, justified now by urgency rather than ideology.\n\nWhat distinguishes the present moment is not the return of imperial instinct. It is the erosion of its disguise.\n\nPrevious administrations practiced conditional sovereignty while insisting—often sincerely—on the language of partnership. The system depended on restraint, predictability, and the appearance of mutual consent. Trump discarded that vocabulary. He spoke of allies as dependents, territory as assets, guarantees as transactions. What earlier administrations implied through doctrine and budget pressure was now stated plainly.\n\nThat bluntness did not create American power. It revealed its grammar.\n\nAllies recognize the sound because they have heard it before. Europe hears it through the memory of postwar dependence. Canada hears it through proximity. Mexico hears it through a border that has always functioned less as a line than as a lever. Even states far from the Atlantic hear it, because American power has always been global in consequence, if not geography.\n\nWhat has changed is how they respond.\n\nWhere earlier eras relied on trust in American stewardship, the contemporary response is procedural insulation: procurement frameworks, trade diversification, legal embedding. The same paperwork once used to project power is now being used to limit exposure to it. SAFE agreements, supply-chain redundancy, and regulatory harmonization are not rejections of American leadership. They are adaptations to its volatility.\n\nWhen sovereignty is treated as conditional, states seek to meet the condition—or escape it. This is not rebellion. It is recalibration.\n\nConditional sovereignty works only so long as the dominant power is predictable. Once predictability fades, the condition itself becomes intolerable.\n\nThat is the quiet danger of the current era. By speaking the logic of dominance too clearly, the United States may be accelerating the erosion of the system it built. Power that once felt stabilizing now feels extractive. Guarantees once assumed now feel provisional.\n\nEmpires rarely collapse when challenged directly. They erode when their paperwork stops persuading the people asked to sign it.\n\nThe pen still scratches. The stamps still fall. But more and more, the room is filling with people who understand the terms—and are deciding, carefully, how much longer they are willing to accept them.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1.
