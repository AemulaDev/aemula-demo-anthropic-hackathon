  "body": "I have a couple of huge stories I want to tell this year. I’m trying to figure out how to do it, and maybe you all can help me with the model — not just the money (though I need help with that too!).\n\nAs anyone who’s tracked my work over a long period can attest, I’m mildly obsessed with funding models, particularly funding models for creative professionals. This matters, and I feel like people drastically underestimate how much it matters. I’ve seen media companies fall apart, artists burn out, and brilliant people across professions fall short of their potential in ways that seem attributable to how they were supporting themselves. But the reason this matters so much is not just because funding enables (or encourages) us to do certain kinds of work, but because the choice of funding model(s) _affects the work itself._ It isn’t always about not getting enough money. Sometimes it’s about getting too much money and not having the discipline to manage it properly, or receiving it from sources whose values are misaligned.\n\nI see this a lot: _**Accepting the wrong money**_ **can destroy careers, and can even destroy people and destroy the spirit of our work, just as surely as** _**running out of money**_ **can.** (This might be a jarring aside for my non-spiritual readers, but: I personally believe these questions about money sources are deeply related to the notion of [spiritual foods](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/spiritual-foods). But I digress.)\n\nOver the course of my adult life, we’ve seen several internet-enabled funding models emerge that changed how creatives were operating, and the changes have been both good and bad. You’re reading this on Substack, which enables people to send me money through the platform and gives me the option to paywall some of my work. (I am extremely grateful to my paid Substack subscribers! Thank you!!) I also ran a Kickstarter campaign when I launched [my magazine](https://thenewmodality.com/) (thank you everyone who donated!!), and I’ve worked in product roles at organizations and spent tons of time in creator communities full of people [trying to figure this out](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/after-xoxo-internet-art-and-culture), so I have a decent sense of the available tools and how they work. I was thinking recently about trying to crowdfund an advance lump sum for these specific stories I want to write, and I realized that I do not recall any examples of an independent writer crowdfunding a nonfiction story in advance, which is discouraging given the amount of knowledge I have about the field. (There are lots of examples of independent game designers and fiction writers crowdfunding stories in advance.)\n\n[I asked people on Twitter/X](https://x.com/lydialaurenson/status/2008648151578931323) if they’ve ever seen a successful example of an independent journalist (or other nonfiction writer) crowdfunding _a specific nonfiction story_ in advance. Then I searched around for other info. It seems rare for journalists to do this, and it also seems like journalists generally don’t earn much money doing it. The LLM built into my browser [said](https://x.com/lydialaurenson/status/2010146275056865746) that it thinks crowdfunded journalism is rare because stories change so much during the reporting process that it’s hard to promise an audience a particular story before the reporting process is done; the LLM suggested that most journalists who succeed at this have already somehow finished most of the reporting process before getting money to support the story, which means they can more accurately pre-describe the story they’re going to write to the audience. It strikes me that there are two problems here, one being that many audiences aren’t super willing to pay for journalism in the first place, and the other that crowdfunding audiences are probably less forgiving of a story changing away from its original description during the reporting process than the typical buyers of a journalism story (publishers, magazines, etc), all of whom are accustomed to stories coming out very differently from what was pitched; for them, major story changes are normal and priced in to their overall model, but not for the typical crowdfunding audience.\n\nAt a meetup last week, I mentioned to some friends that I’m thinking about this. One of them said he wondered what would happen if I let people “invest” in a story I’m writing, in exchange for a promised slice of future earnings on that story. This could come to a lot of money if there is a way to earn royalties from that specific story, and/or if the story has unusually high potential for a film adaptation. This was not an option I’d considered previously, and I’m not sure if anyone would be excited about such an investment opportunity, especially because I suspect that a lot of the same people who would invest in this way would be just as interested in giving a grant — but I’m not sure.\n\nA couple people at the meetup also pointed me in the direction of Yancey Strickler’s 2025 TED Talk, “[Forget hustle culture. Behold the Artist Corporation](https://www.ted.com/talks/yancey_strickler_forget_hustle_culture_behold_the_artist_corporation).” Strickler, who is himself [both a creative professional and a co-founder of Kickstarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yancey_Strickler), seems like he thinks a lot like I think; for instance, he recently published an anthology where he structured a revenue-sharing agreement among its contributors that’s pretty much the same as an anthology I created in 2012. Strickler’s anthology was way more financially successful than ours, though! I’m heartened to see that there are heavyweights in the field experimenting with new models, though apparently there are not yet any extant examples of Artist Corporations in the wild. (This is a side note, but I’ve often thought that it would make sense for future journalism companies to have a relationship with their writers more similar to “talent management” companies, where they represent their writers as speakers and take cuts of the speaking fees and such. I wonder if future A Corps will do this.)\n\nI’m not yet close to earning enough money on Substack to write here full-time. I think I have the potential to get there with a longer time horizon, but I don’t have a way of knowing how long it will take. And, not to put too fine a point on it, I have to materialize a lot more income for myself very soon. The amount of money I need to support myself and my son is unlikely to come from selling these stories to magazines, which are cash-strapped, and besides, I am becoming more dubious about the value of working with mainstream magazines anyway (I don’t want to type out the reasons for this right now, but I may talk about them in future posts). I could try to get a book deal with a major publisher, but those deals take forever and demand an enormous amount of up-front work before you get any money, and the editorial process is uncertain, plus this would mean that the stories wouldn’t be available to the public unless they buy the book, which feels like a big lift for audiences these days, which means the stories’ reach would be limited. I may go in one of those directions despite their limitations, but more and more I feel excited about trying a different model for these stories.\n\nI’m going to try posing these questions to people in my community, and pitching these stories as fundable projects, and seeing what happens next. This might not get funding to help me produce the stories I want to produce, but it will probably be interesting, at least. My request for you, if you’ve made it to the end of this post, is to let me know: Is there anything I should be thinking about that I missed? Are there any other creator support models you’ve seen in action, and which you think I should be looking into?\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
