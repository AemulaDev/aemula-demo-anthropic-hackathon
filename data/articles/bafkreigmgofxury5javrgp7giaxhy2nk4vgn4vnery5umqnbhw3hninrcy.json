The day-by-day, even hour-by-hour unraveling shows just how quickly a modern bank run can still bring a giant to its knees._\n\nThe economy was contracting toward the end of 2022; interest rates were climbing, and inflation persisted. SVB customers began tapping into their savings accounts, forcing the bank to sell some of its longer-term bonds at a significant loss because newly issued bonds were yielding above 4%.\n\nBy the close of 2022, the bank's financial situation worsened, with $25 billion or 13% of cash reserves drained. Deposits spiraled further, particularly in checking accounts managed by medium and large telecommunications companies. On February 24, SVB finalized its annual report, followed by an announcement on March 8 that it would sell Held-to-Maturity bonds at a $1.8 billion loss to cover increasing withdrawals and raise $2.25 billion by selling more stock. The bank's stock price plummeted over 60%, triggering concerns about potential losses for other large banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. A historic decline saw over $52 billion in value wiped from the banking and financial services industry in a single trading session. Moody's downgraded SVB's rating, further damaging its stock price.\n\nPanic spread in Silicon Valley as startup founders and CEOs warned colleagues to withdraw funds. By Friday, March 10th, markets were in chaos, prompting federal regulators to halt SVB's stock to allow investors to regroup. By the end of the day, it became the second-largest collapse in U.S. banking history, only outdone by Washington Mutual’s collapse in 2008.\n\nOver the weekend, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assured depositors they would have access to their money by Monday morning, up to the standard $250,000 limit per account. However, no guarantee was made for deposits exceeding this limit. Tech companies rushed to secure funding over the weekend, causing bank runs at other regional banks like First Republic and Signature. Regulators took control of Signature, making it the third-largest bank collapse.\n\n_SVB’s downfall proved that once confidence evaporates, a bank can unravel faster than anyone imagines. Next week, we’ll see how regulators continue racing to contain the panic and stop a regional crisis from becoming a nationwide meltdown._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
