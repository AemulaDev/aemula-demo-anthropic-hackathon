  "body": "I don’t like having my views challenged.\n\nSometimes it’s just dealing with the same tired objections that have already been refuted; other times, I find myself in the middle of a tug-of-war between two opposing parties that care less about me than they do about my support for their side. And there are still other times when I have spent a bit of time and effort in arriving at the position I hold, and I understand the justifications for my views, which should not be set aside lightly.\n\nAnd when my views are challenged, I’m not too happy with the interlocutor who challenged my views.\n\nThe identity of the challenger can certainly shape how a challenge is received, but should that make a difference in how we respond to contrary beliefs? It’s possible, if the challenger is not acting in good faith, but I think that everyone can agree that bad-faith interlocutors should be shunned with prejudice and thus do not warrant further discussion. What I am more interested in are sincere, good-faith opponents who sharply disagree with us on a given position and who may very well be “playing for the opposing team.” Do such people exist? I think they do, and they can help us argue more honestly and persuasively for our own positions.\n\nThis requires patience, humility, and a willingness to see beyond an apparent conflict in order to address real issues. We often get irritated or upset at people who disagree with us on major issues, and this blinds us to the substance of the opposing argument. What if we instead focused on the substance of the argument rather than the perceived character of the interlocutor? We don’t have to agree with the argument, but we should be able to address the points being made in the argument and respond to those points.\n\nWill it accomplish what we were hoping for? Perhaps not. But it will help to improve understanding of the issues at hand, which is a worthwhile goal.",
