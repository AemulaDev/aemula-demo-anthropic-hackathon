  "body": "Welcome to the AWM Financial Newsletter! Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nWalk around UNC Charlotte’s Atkins Library, and you notice three main things: endless Instagram reels, many tabs of ChatGPT, and mountains of Apple products. Enough iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, and Watches to stretch across North Carolina and back. I didn’t actually measure it, but you get the idea. Apple is everywhere.\n\nLast week, we read how the Morgans secured their future through consistent saving habits in _[…and the Future They Secured](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/and-the-future-they-secured?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_. And while this week could easily turn into a thesis on why to buy Apple stock, today I want to break down the seemingly omnipresent Apple Card, its key benefits and drawbacks, and how I personally use it in my own wallet.\n\nWe’ve talked plenty about the Fidelity Visa Signature 2% Cashback Card. (and no, I’m still not sponsored by Fidelity) It’s a stellar baseline card that’s simple, clean, and all without an annual fee.\n\n## What You Actually Get With the Apple Card\n\nThe Apple Card is basically the same with a twist. You get 2% cashback on everything, but only if you use Apple Pay instead of the physical card. And while 85% of U.S. retailers accept Apple Pay, that still leaves a one-in-seven chance your favorite coffee shop acts like it’s 2012 and doesn’t take it.\n\nThe Apple Card also has no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees, and no late or returned payment fees. Still, the interest rate can hit 24%, and if you’re a college student with thin credit history, you can assume you’re getting the high end of that range.\n\nThe 3% cashback is where it shines. All Apple purchases earn 3%, including App Store subscriptions and in-app purchases. That’s huge if, like me, you prefer setting up subscriptions directly inside the app instead of hunting down the website.\n\nApple also partners with merchants such as Uber, Walgreens, Exxon, and Nike to offer an extra 3% cashback. I ignore those because I prefer a simple, predictable wallet lineup, and most of those categories are already covered by other rewards cards.\n\nThe really exciting part is the Daily Cash feature. You earn cashback instantly instead of waiting for your statement to close. You can route that Daily Cash straight into an Apple Savings account, which currently yields 3.65%, and it automatically converts to Apple Cash for app purchases or to send to a friend.\n\nSince half of campus is basically on payroll for Tim Apple thanks to App Store subscriptions, you might as well earn 3% on yours. Let the cashback sit in savings, and you get a mini flywheel quietly shrinking your bill over time.\n\nApplying is painless. Apple does a soft pull, so you can check your approval odds with zero credit damage. With a 715 score and just over a year of credit history, I was approved for a $1,000 credit line on my second try. It’s not the easiest card to get, but it’s far from the hardest.\n\nThe whole thing takes about five minutes and looks way better than the average bank’s application page. As you’d expect with Apple’s typical elegance, the app is sleek, modern, and extremely clear about your spending and available credit. Additionally, the payment graphic is beneficial for folks newer to credit cards, as it clearly displays due dates and outstanding balances.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ERm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e337c8-6962-48af-902c-55a938ca5dcc_495x989.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ERm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e337c8-6962-48af-902c-55a938ca5dcc_495x989.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Here’s mine so far: $0 spent, $1 tucked into savings, and everything looking way cleaner than any bank app has a right to.}}\n\nYes, they offer a very cool, very sleek, physical titanium card for in-person purchases when Apple Pay isn’t accepted, and it earns a garbage 1%. I don’t need another physical card fattening my wallet anyway, so I’ve opted out of receiving one.\n\n## Why it’s in my Wallet\n\nI have the AirPods, the Watch, the phone, and now even an iPad. I’m locked into the walled garden like everyone else, and my subsequent big tech purchases will probably be Apple again.\n\nWhich brings me to the main reason I got the card: 0% APR financing on Apple products. Combine that with 3% Daily Cash upfront, and it becomes a clean liquidity tool. I can invest the freed-up cash to fuel my next App Store doodad while I pay off my Vision Pro over time. Just kidding, that thing would make me dizzy and make me throw up in five seconds.\n\nIt’s a decent card, especially if you live inside the Apple ecosystem. I’ll be using it as my default card in the App Store to collect that 3% cashback, and I’ll use it again when I buy my next iPhone.\n\nThis was my second attempt at applying. They denied me the first time back when I tried to finance an iPad at the start of the semester, likely because my credit history was less than a year old, so fair enough. I applied again because they’re offering $75 extra cashback after spending $75 in the first 30 days. That’s easy for me, given my regular purchases.\n\nYou still shouldn’t spend extra money to chase cashback, but if you were going to buy it anyway, take the free money. A little bit goes a long way, especially when time is your biggest asset. I don’t plan to spend much on the Apple Card beyond occasional tech upgrades and regular App Store purchases. Still, at the end of the day, I get 3% back and a clean, automatic savings feature. That’s enough for me.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
