Donors lean closer. A historian lowers his pen. The motor hums softly beneath the display.\n\n“Who’s this intended to honor?”\n\nDonald Trump doesn’t hesitate.\n\n**“Me.”¹**\n\nThe arch keeps rotating.\n\nThe answer lands with a familiarity that has followed Trump for decades. He has repeatedly tried to attach his name — and sometimes his image — to structures meant to outlast him. During his presidency, aides confirmed that Trump raised the possibility of adding his face to Mount Rushmore. The suggestion prompted enough internal discussion that White House staff requested background materials on how the monument had been carved and whether expansion was technically possible.²\n\nHe has floated similar ideas about attaching his name to major public infrastructure, including Pennsylvania Station in New York and Washington Dulles International Airport — places Americans pass through not ceremonially, but automatically, as part of daily movement.³ ⁴\n\nThe proposed arch belongs inside that same continuum. It is less a single monument concept than another attempt to convert personal legacy into national geography.\n\nThat helps explain why its design language leans toward triumphal architecture. Arches are not subtle memorials. They are declarations — structures built to signal victory, permanence, and narrative closure.\n\nThe design circulating in early America 250 planning discussions openly borrows from that tradition. The most famous example stands in Paris, where Napoleon commissioned the Arc de Triomphe to transform battlefield success into permanent civic mythology.\n\nAmerica has always remembered itself at monumental scale. The National Mall reads like a marble-and-granite timeline: Washington rising skyward, Lincoln seated in temple stillness, Roosevelt carved into stone with quotations meant to speak across generations. Monumental architecture has never been subtle here. It has been civic theater.\n\nSupporters of a 250th anniversary monument argue the country deserves another act.\n\n“Washington celebrates presidents and wars,” one donor involved in early discussions said. “It doesn’t celebrate the survival of the country itself.”\n\nThe argument carries real historical precedent. Nations routinely build anniversary monuments to reassure themselves that they endured.\n\nBut monuments rarely function as neutral historical summaries. They are spatial arguments about which version of history deserves permanence.\n\nArchitectural historian Kirk Savage describes the National Mall as a curated landscape of narratives in which power determines which stories become physical landmarks. Triumphal arches take that logic further. They turn history into a doorway citizens are expected to walk through, implying the journey has already ended in triumph.⁵\n\nOr, as one preservation historian summarized during a lecture on memorial design:\n\n“An arch tells citizens they’ve already passed successfully through history.”\n\nBuilding anything on the National Mall is deliberately slow. Under the Commemorative Works Act, proposals require congressional approval, environmental review, and oversight for preservation. The process can take a decade or longer.⁶ Whether this arch ever rises remains uncertain.\n\nThe instinct behind it is not.\n\nRobert Ellison has spent most of his professional life working inside that instinct. A retired National Park Service engineer, he helped oversee preservation projects across the Mall for three decades. He studies renderings of the arch at his Arlington kitchen table, coffee cooling beside laminated site maps.\n\n“You don’t build something like that to fill space,” he says, sliding the printout across the table. “You build it to dominate space.”\n\nHe studies the drawing longer than the quote requires.\n\n“I’m not against monuments,” he adds. “Half the ones people argue about now, I helped stabilize.”\n\nHe carefully aligns the blueprint, tapping its edge square against the table.\n\n“Monuments don’t just commemorate history,” he continues. “They compete with it.”\n\nTrump’s attraction to monumental symbolism predates politics. His Manhattan developments fused architecture with brand identity decades before his presidential run. Trump Tower, completed in 1983, turned marble, brass, and gold leaf into marketing language. Visibility replaced subtlety. Presence replaced restraint.⁷\n\nArchitect Tamara Peacock, who worked on Mar-a-Lago renovations, later described how personally Trump directed decorative decisions.\n\n“He added the gold and the chandeliers… I don’t think I’d ever ordered gold plumbing.”⁷\n\nPolitical scientists describe this aesthetic as personalistic symbolism — leadership styles that merge institutional authority with individual identity through spectacle, naming, and visual scale.\n\nComparable strategies appear across multiple political systems, though each emerges from its own cultural and historical context.\n\nIn Russia, Vladimir Putin oversaw the construction of the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces, completed in 2020 as both a military memorial and a religious monument. Russian officials described incorporating materials made from melted Nazi weaponry, deliberately merging military victory with national identity.⁸\n\nIn Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan built the Ak Saray presidential complex despite court rulings challenging aspects of its legality. The project marked a visible shift from republican restraint toward imagery associated with Ottoman imperial authority.⁹\n\nThese systems are not equivalent. But they reveal a shared architectural logic: monumental construction used to align state legitimacy with individual leadership narratives.\n\nTrump’s proposals operate within the constraints of American democracy. Yet his emphasis on branding and naming produces stylistic parallels with global traditions of leader-centered symbolic construction.\n\nEllison sees the connection less as ideology than as scale.\n\n“When something gets big enough,” he says, “it stops marking time. It starts trying to define it.”\n\nSupporters of assertive civic monuments argue that strong national symbols can unify fractured societies. They note that the Lincoln Memorial itself faced early criticism as grandiose and politically charged before becoming one of the country’s most powerful democratic symbols.¹⁰\n\nMonuments also acquire meanings their creators never fully control. The Lincoln Memorial, originally conceived partly as a reconciliation monument after the Civil War, later became a central stage for the civil rights movement — most famously during Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 speech. Structures designed to stabilize history often become platforms for its renegotiation.\n\nEllison says timing is where the fault line emerges.\n\n“Memorials usually reflect consensus built after history settles,” he says. “Building them while the story is still unfolding changes what they’re doing.”\n\nLate afternoon light spreads across the Potomac as Ellison watches footage of the rotating arch model from his living room television. The river flows past monuments dedicated to figures whose memorials were constructed long after their deaths.\n\nTrump’s approach reverses that chronology. Legacy is proposed before historical judgment.\n\nThe distinction matters because memorial landscapes shape how nations narrate themselves. They influence which values appear permanent, which leaders appear foundational, and which conflicts appear resolved.\n\nThe arch remains conceptual. Infrastructure renaming proposals remain speculative. Congressional approval and preservation law make realization uncertain.\n\nBut the proposals expose a deeper tension within democratic symbolism: whether national memory emerges gradually through collective reflection or is asserted quickly through executive influence and branding culture—and who ultimately controls the stories that become national landmarks.\n\nEllison leans forward as the model continues its slow mechanical rotation on television.\n\n“You build something like that,” he says quietly, “and you’re not just remembering history.”\n\nHe watches the model complete another turn.\n\n“You’re arguing about who gets to write it.”\n\nOutside, the river flows past marble, bronze, and granite — monuments created over two centuries of debate about how a democracy remembers itself.\n\nThat argument never settles permanently. Every generation decides which names it carves into stone, which ones it questions, and which ones it leaves for history to judge later.\n\nAnd in a democracy, those decisions shape not just memory — but power.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1.
