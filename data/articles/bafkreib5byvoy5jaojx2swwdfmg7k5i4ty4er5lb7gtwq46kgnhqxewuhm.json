Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nEveryone’s favorite part of heading into the new year is the chance to open a new chapter, whether that’s in life, school, or your career. It’s an exciting time to reset, create a fresh start, or maybe just break all your resolutions in the first week. Either way, the actual most exciting part of the new year is the ability to make Roth IRA contributions for a brand-new tax year.\n\nLast week in “_[Hold the Cash the Smarter Way](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/hold-cash-the-smarter-way?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)”_, we talked about how to optimize your savings so they’re working for you and not the big banks. This week, we’re tackling one of the biggest sources of confusion for investors. Should you dollar-cost average, or should you invest a lump sum today?\n\nFor all the non-finance bros out there, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is the process of making repeated investments in an asset, typically a stock or an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is simply a bundle of stocks. Over time, your weekly or monthly investments purchase shares at different prices.\n\nOne month, the market may be down due to a geopolitical event, letting you buy at a discount compared to your last purchase. In other months, the market will be up, and you’ll pay a higher price. Either way, these purchases are spread out over time and slowly develop into a larger position.\n\nLump-sum investing is simply taking the money you have to invest and purchasing all your shares at once. In general, markets rise over time, with the S\\&P 500, which tracks America’s 500 largest public companies, averaging around 10% annual returns for roughly a century.\n\nBut what if something happens during the year? Of course, the S\\&P 500 doesn’t go up every single year, so maybe you think you can time the market and buy when prices drop.\n\nAccording to a Vanguard [study](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better) from 2023, lump-sum investing tends to outperform dollar-cost averaging because you take on risk earlier, which also means you start getting rewarded by the market sooner, considering markets rise over time. Historically, this has held true, with DCA strategies shown to underperform by roughly two percentage points annually, which becomes meaningful over decades. As the old saying goes, time in the market beats timing the market.\n\nFor example, if you had invested $125 per week last year, given the S\\&P 500’s 16.4% gain, you would’ve ended up with just over $7,000. In comparison, investing the full amount upfront would have resulted in an ending value of more than $7,500. While this assumes returns were spread evenly throughout the year, which isn’t exactly how markets behave, the illustration still highlights the benefit of getting invested sooner rather than later.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hQUc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56882c06-4f43-4460-bcab-90b0d2c1f5d2_1536x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hQUc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56882c06-4f43-4460-bcab-90b0d2c1f5d2_1536x1024.png)\n\n{{caption:$100/month versus $1,200 at the beginning of each year over 30 years ends in a nearly $10k differnce!}}\n\nThat said, dollar-cost averaging makes a lot more sense when investing in individual companies. While it’s difficult to time the overall stock market, specific news, earnings reports, and other catalysts can heavily impact a single company. Because of that, averaging into a position you’re betting on over time is often the better approach.\n\nWhen I started buying Warner Bros. Discovery a few years ago, I didn’t purchase all my shares at once because an earnings report was coming up, and I had no idea how the market would react. The company dropped more than 15% after a negative report, but it didn’t change my long-term thesis.\n\nThe market’s short-term freakout allowed me to accumulate more shares at a discount. Of course, this could have gone the opposite way, forcing me to pay a higher price later, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take, because I can’t see the future. If you can, please leave a comment. I’d love to know what’s coming next.\n\nSome people max out their Roth IRAs on day one of the new year as fast as Planet Fitness fills up in early January. Whether you are moving over thousands on January 1 or setting up a humble $25/week, the biggest priority is simply to invest.\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t have $7,500 lying around, and most students and young professionals don’t either. Regardless of how you get there, make filling your Roth IRA a goal this year, and don’t let that resolution fall off faster than a newly minted gym rat in early February.\n\n_Read about how the Roth IRA works, and how it can benefit you at all stages of life:_\n\n[The First Small Choice...](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-first-small-choice)\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
