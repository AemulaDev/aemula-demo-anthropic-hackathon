It settles across the cracked ground in amber, as though the heat has finally stopped arguing with the day. Out by the migrant processing stations at the edge of town, the chain-link fences throw **lean, stretched** shadows. A border patrol agent pulls up in a dust-coated SUV and lowers his window. He nods toward a handful of men crouched under a mesquite tree.\n\n“Guatemalan,” he says. Not dismissive. Not harsh. Just a tired fact. “Waitin’ to get caught.”\n\nHe rubs the bridge of his nose before reaching for a water bottle. After twenty years out here, he reads people the way some men read engines—**the dust on their shoes, the angle of their shoulders, the small pause between walking and waiting**. As he turns the radio dial, one of the men—young, maybe early twenties—adjusts his baseball cap and raises his hand in an uncertain gesture.\n\n“Chicago,” he calls out in halting English. “You think… possible?”\n\nThere’s a flicker across the agent’s face—not quite surprise, not quite sympathy—as the question hangs between them, fragile in the heat.\n\nTwo thousand miles away, in a chilled TV studio where nothing smells like dust or sunburnt metal, J.D. Vance is telling America that Democrats are “importing voters.” The line has been tested and trimmed. It lands better than saying “replacing whites.” Same fear. Better packaging. In his telling, the border isn’t a line. **It’s a story.** And he intends to be the one **directing** it.\n\nThe fight over who belongs used to move gradually—through editorials, court rulings, dinner-table arguments that stretched across generations. Under Trump, Miller, and their ideological heirs, the pace has jumped to something frantic and punitive—a churn of spectacle meant to collapse the distance between policy and identity. Immigration becomes the stage. Identity becomes the script. Who belongs. Who threatens. Who deserves.\n\n“If you’re not willing to deport a lot of people,” Vance told ABC’s _This Week_ in August 2024, “you’re not willing to have a border.”¹\n\nIt wasn’t a policy proposal. It was a declaration of who counts.\n\nAmerica has always carried two contradictory stories about itself. One cast in bronze at the base of the Statue of Liberty. One written into the Chinese Exclusion Act. Freedom and fear, less than twenty years apart. Ask Americans whether immigrants make the country stronger and 79 percent say yes. Ask whether the southern border is “under siege,” and most say yes to that too.²\n\nPolling doesn’t solve the contradiction. It just admits it.\n\nStephen Miller understood that long before most operatives did. In 2015, while drafting Trump’s early campaign language, he wasn’t just ghosting speeches—he was designing a worldview. Emails later published by the Southern Poverty Law Center show him steering Breitbart editors toward white-nationalist sources like VDARE and American Renaissance, and recommending _The Camp of the Saints,_ a French novel depicting migrants—**in the novel’s depiction**—as a dehumanized mass overwhelming Europe.³\n\n“You see the Pope saying the West must, in effect, get rid of borders,” he wrote in one message. “Someone should point out the parallels to _Camp of the Saints._”⁴\n\nThis wasn’t mischief. It was an instruction manual. In Miller’s logic, **movement became menace** and **skin became signal**. If people could be turned into symbols—grim, threatening, inevitable—then cruelty could be reframed as protection. And protection is always good politics.\n\nThat logic exploded in Springfield, Ohio, in 2024, when Vance boosted a fake story claiming Haitian migrants were abducting and eating pets. No evidence. No missing animals. No credible witnesses.\n\n“If I have to create stories so the media pays attention to the suffering of the American people,” he told a radio host, “then that’s what I’m going to do.”⁵\n\nIt wasn’t just an admission that the story was false. It was an admission that truth wasn’t the point. In towns where the paper mill closed fifteen years ago, where the volunteer fire siren cuts through long stretches of quiet, where the grocery store’s shelves feel a little thinner every year, people feel something has slipped from their grasp. They’re not wrong about the loss. They’re just being told the wrong culprit.\n\nA high-school principal in western Pennsylvania told me as much during another surge of rumors. She spoke softly, as if the empty hallway outside her office might listen.\n\n“It’s never the facts,” she said. “It’s the feeling that the town is slipping. People mistake that for invasion.”\n\nShe didn’t sound angry. She sounded tired—like someone who had watched fear settle over a place grain by grain.\n\nFear moves faster than nuance. So the story about jobs becomes a story about betrayal. The story about the border becomes a story about invasion. And the story about who belongs becomes a story about who deserves.\n\nIn 2019, Ken Cuccinelli, Trump’s acting head of USCIS, offered his own revision of the Lazarus poem:\n\n“Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.”⁶\n\nHe later clarified that Lazarus was speaking only of Europeans.\n\nBut beneath the symbolism, the data tell another story. Immigrants commit less crime than native-born Americans—a pattern documented across more than a century.⁷ They contribute more to GDP than they draw in services, with wage effects that are minimal and temporary.⁸ Their children typically outpace native-born peers in education, income, and civic engagement.⁹ And the real frustration—delays, backlogs, mismanagement—has its own measurable shape: **the median asylum wait time is now more than four years**, driven by staffing shortages, policy whiplash, and record caseloads.\n\nIt’s not threat. It’s failure—of administration, not of people.\n\nOne analyst put it plainly:\n\n“Rapid, poorly managed immigration landing on communities already in economic and status decline is the problem. ‘Slow assimilation’ is the story people tell about it afterward.”\n\nThat distinction—the line between overload and existential threat—is the fulcrum of the entire debate. And modern immigration politics is built to erase it. Trump and Miller didn’t start that erasure. They industrialized it.\n\nBy 2025, Kristi Noem was running DHS and declaring that “illegal aliens” must “leave our country NOW or face deportation.” Her imagery was familiar: invasion, war zone, cartels. She’d already been banned from multiple Native reservations for accusing tribal leaders of colluding with Mexican traffickers—without evidence.¹⁰\n\nBut evidence wasn’t the currency. Narrative was. The media ecosystem rewarded the conflict; fear, once shaped, **carried the story**. The border wasn’t a place. **It was a screen.** And the people crossing it were no longer people—they were characters in a morality play about control.\n\n“There’s 20 million people here illegally,” Vance said in 2024. “Let’s start with one million.”¹¹\n\nStart where? The poultry plants in Alabama? The nursing homes in Indiana? The overnight warehouses staffed by people in no position to complain? The hurricane rebuild crews? The church basements where volunteers ladle soup under flickering fluorescent lights?\n\nThis was never only about law. It was about scale—of action, of spectacle, of story. A nation of immigrants cannot pivot to mass deportation without first learning to see compassion as weakness and inclusion as danger. That is the political project: **make cruelty feel like order.**\n\n“I would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil,” Miller once said.⁴\n\nHe meant it.\n\nBack in Yuma, the sun drops fast. The desert turns dusky and soft. The mesquite shadows stretch, thin out, and disappear. The agent who labeled the men “Guatemalan” is handing out water bottles now. The young man who hopes for Chicago waits in line, sweat darkening his shirt.\n\n“I just need a number,” he says quietly. “Someplace to start.”\n\nBehind him, the desert stays silent.\n\nA different truth waits—one that doesn’t fit on any politician’s screen.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
