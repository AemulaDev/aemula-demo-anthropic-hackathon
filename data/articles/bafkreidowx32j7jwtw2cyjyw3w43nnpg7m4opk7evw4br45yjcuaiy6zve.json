This is biased: St. John’s—and really all of Newfoundland—is one of my favorite places on Earth. Years ago, I picked up a copy of _Rogues and Branding Irons_ by Jack Fitzgerald. It was sharp and strange and local, filled with characters who didn’t fit anywhere else.\n\nThat book returned to me with the smell of salt and spring chill. And with it, the question: how many countries—because Newfoundland was once its own—have such a short, strange, loud political history?\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yikJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcbfeea8-ebd9-4241-a60a-c2a088a99762_2380x1382.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yikJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcbfeea8-ebd9-4241-a60a-c2a088a99762_2380x1382.jpeg)\n\nStart with the piano.\n\nThey hauled it out of the Colonial Building in the chaos of April 1932—legs splintering, keys jangling. A single, stubborn B-flat rang out before the whole thing gave way: ivory, felt, and timber exploding in Bannerman Park like punctuation at the end of a bad decade¹.\n\nSir Richard Squires was already bleeding by then. He’d tried to flee but was caught and clubbed by a crowd that no longer believed in petitions.\n\n**“Sometimes you smash the music to be heard.”**\n\nTwo years later, Newfoundland voted to suspend self-government. A British-appointed Commission took over in early 1934. But something had snapped that night—not just in politics, but in the island’s self-image.\n\nSquires hadn’t started corrupt. A gifted orator from Harbour Grace, he rose on promises of reform. But as the economy buckled, he doubled down on patronage. By 1923, he’d been arrested for corruption—then reelected in 1928, unrepentant.\n\nThe riot wasn’t sudden. It had simmered for years—in shuttered storefronts, in fish prices, in the distance between speeches and supper.\n\nLong before the piano fell, Newfoundland had flirted with collapse. In 1908, a tie election left the House deadlocked—eighteen seats apiece for Robert Bond and Edward Morris. No Speaker. No progress². The governor refused dissolution. So they tried again in 1909.\n\nEven the legislature’s ceiling told a story. Painted in 1880 by Alexander Pindikowski, a convicted forger doing time for bad cheques, loaned out from jail for his steady hand³.\n\n**“In St. John’s, even the ceilings are improvised.”**\n\nThe Commission arrived in 1934. No elections. No opposition. For fifteen years, the island was ruled from above. But the quiet didn’t last.\n\nJoey Smallwood had a lisp and a love of microphones. In 1937, he launched _The Barrelman_—a radio ritual for kitchens from Port aux Basques to Nain.\n\n“People of Newfoundland,” he’d begin, “this is your story I tell.”\n\nThen he vanished. In 1943, he left broadcasting to raise pigs at Gander. “_I had great plans for my pig business… to start the finest and most modern piggery in Newfoundland,_” he later wrote⁴. He pitched pork like policy: with maps, ratios, and a little showmanship.\n\nIt wasn’t a detour. It was rehearsal.\n\nAfter Confederation in 1949, Smallwood returned as premier. He governed like someone still holding the mic.\n\nHis most lasting legacy was resettlement. Over 300 outports were abandoned. Nearly 30,000 people were relocated⁵.\n\nOn paper, it was modernization. In kitchens, it was grief.\n\n**“Numbers fix budgets. They don’t quiet wind around a vacated cove.”**\n\nBoats were left to rot. Graves to salt. Some families never reconciled. Smallwood believed he was saving the future. But he mistook movement for consent.\n\nBrian Peckford didn’t. In the 1980s, with offshore oil in sight, he fought Ottawa for control. The 1985 Atlantic Accord gave Newfoundland joint management and revenue rights⁷.\n\nAt the microphone, Peckford said: _“Some day the sun will shine, and ‘have not’ will be no more.”_\n\nThe sun did shine. But not forever.\n\nBy 1990, Newfoundland was again in the national drama. Premier Clyde Wells opposed the Meech Lake Accord. When Manitoba’s Elijah Harper blocked it, Wells cancelled Newfoundland’s vote⁸.\n\n**“Meech didn’t fail in Newfoundland. It was refused.”**\n\nSome called him a spoiler. Others, a constitutional steward. Either way, he pulled the brake.\n\nThen came Danny.\n\nDanny Williams was blunt and camera-ready. In 2004, he ordered all Canadian flags removed from provincial buildings. _“The federal government has turned its back on the people of this province,”_ he said. \\*“We will not accept less than what was committed.”\\*⁹\n\nThe flags came down before Christmas. They returned after talks resumed.\n\nFour years later, he ran the ABC—_Anything But Conservative_—campaign. Every Tory in the province lost.\n\n**“Out here, leverage isn’t a tactic. It’s survival.”**\n\nEven Newfoundland’s illegality had style. In the 1920s, American rum-runners registered under the Newfoundland flag to dodge U.S. patrols¹⁰. It wasn’t deception. It was seamanship.\n\nAnd so, we return—again—to that piano.\n\nIt was owned by Miss Morris, a schoolteacher whose name faded faster than her instrument. That night in 1932, she watched from the crowd as men dragged it downhill. Someone tried to save it. She later told a reporter she’d shouted, _“Play it first!”_ But they didn’t.\n\nThey weren’t smashing music. They were smashing silence.\n\nThat’s the arc. That’s the echo.\n\nEach time Newfoundland is told to yield—it raises a piano. Or a flag. Or a microphone.\n\nIt doesn’t always get it right. But it never stays quiet.\n\n_And maybe that’s why I keep returning. To ferry docks and wind-scoured bookshelves. Because Newfoundland reminds you: a place can fracture, retreat, and still rise. And if it’s lucky, maybe even sing again._\n\n**They were not always right. They were always, unmistakably, from here.**\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\.
