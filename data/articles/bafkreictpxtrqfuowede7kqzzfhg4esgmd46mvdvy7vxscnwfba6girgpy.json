Morgan warning me that a transaction had been cancelled for “potentially fraudulent activity,” which is corporate code for: you’re about to spend the rest of your day proving you exist.\n\nI dialed the number. A voice from a Mumbai call center—a bright, overworked voice—answered. I could hear the script pages flipping.\n\n“Sir, please confirm your name?”\n\nWe go through the warm-up act—address, account, last four digits—and then he asks, with surprising gravity, what he should call me.\n\n“Bill,” I said. “Just Bill.”\n\n“Hello, Mr. Just Beel.”¹\n\nNothing prepares you for the moment a bank decides your identity is a hypothesis. Increasingly, the modern world doesn’t verify transactions; it verifies people—and it makes us audition for our own lives.\n\nHe launched into the ritual: he would text me a code; I would confirm yes; he would ask questions; I would comply like a man testifying before a committee investigating the circumstances of his own birth. But it veered off the rails almost immediately.\n\n“How did you find this merchant? Have you met them in person? Have they ever threatened you? Are you in any danger right now?”\n\nThen came the deeper cuts: childhood address, children’s names, a list of every company I’d ever been “associated with.” Chase was assembling a forensic autobiography before allowing a simple wire transfer that was supposed to take twenty minutes.\n\nEventually, the agent cleared me. My cancelled transaction was reinstated. I thanked him, even though he’d just interviewed me like a mid-level defector.\n\nTwo hours later, the phone rang again. Same department. Different agent. Same script. Same transaction. And then it happened again a few hours later.\n\nBy evening, I expected them to ask where I got the radioactive watch hands for the high school cloud chamber I had built for a science fair project. The absurdity became its own fascination, so I did what you do in 2025 when the world stops making sense: I started digging.\n\nBBB. CFPB’s Consumer Complaint Database. The complaints were everywhere—tens of thousands of them. People describing exactly what I was experiencing: repeated calls, interrogations across time zones, and transactions canceled over and over. It wasn’t a glitch. It was a symptom of the same verification theater creeping into everything else.\n\nAnd Chase was only one room in a much larger maze that was affecting all of us.\n\nThe first code arrives before the Keurig finishes brewing. Six digits, “expires in 10 minutes.” Anna glances at it, types it into her laptop, and the page refreshes into a demand for another code. Her phone buzzes. The TV in the living room informs her that her device is no longer part of the approved Netflix “Household,” a polite way of saying her television does not believe she lives where she lives. She calls her brother; he reads her the code—and then gets his own location check. By the time they’re done, the coffee is cold.\n\nSecurity isn’t the threat. The performance of security is.\n\nAnna hasn’t been hacked. Nothing is compromised. She just wants to watch a show and pay a bill. What began as a simple second factor has expanded into a branching maze of doubts—codes, confirmations, CAPTCHAs, browser hygiene tests—each one treating her like a shoplifter in her own digital life.\n\nCAPTCHAs ask her to distinguish crosswalks that blur into parking lots², or identify traffic lights half-obscured behind algorithmic graffiti³. The images look like they were curated by algorithms for algorithms: distorted fragments of Street View trained on a version of the world no human recognizes. No one mentions the private humiliation of failing a test designed to distinguish you from a robot.\n\nAnd the more tightly identity is policed through screens, the stranger the consequences become. A longtime user of a major social platform recently lost access to her entire digital life—photos, messages, work documents—not because she was hacked, but because she failed the site’s identity test. The answers she gave were correct, but not the answers she had given fifteen years earlier. The algorithm trusted its memory of her more than the person herself.\n\nAnd where screens fail, voices take over.\n\nDavid hits his breaking point when his bank cancels a $6 corner-store purchase and calls him back “for his protection.” There’s a click, then a voice trying to pronounce his name.\n\n“Hello sir, am I speaking with… Day-veed… Dee-veed… Deevid Jons?”\n\nThe line is thin. The script is rigid. The agent tries again, each repetition faster, more anxious, as if clarity itself might get him flagged. Call-center workers are trained to flatten their accents into a “neutral global voice” that isn’t theirs⁴. Many describe feeling erased, blamed, or exhausted by the emotional labor of apologizing for decisions made far upstream in systems they never touch⁵.\n\nIf the maze is impossible, the guide will always be mistaken for the villain.\n\nThe identity questions become surreal. Which of these addresses have you never lived at? What year did you take out an auto loan? What color was your first car?\n\nBut the system feeds the agent American street names that twist into phonetic puzzles; Midwestern brand names collapse into static as he tries to interpret them. When he reaches David’s high-school landline—a number abandoned before the iPhone existed—David closes his eyes. Both men are trapped: one with the authority but none of the context; the other with the context but none of the authority.\n\nMeanwhile, streaming platforms wage their own border dispute. Netflix, tightening password rules, now flags devices that can’t be matched to a home network⁶. Travelers, students, seasonal workers—collateral damage in a digital residency dispute. VPN detectors misfire, assuming anyone near a crowded cell tower must be tunneling through another country⁷. Silicon Valley calls these “edge cases.” Normal people call them ruined evenings.\n\nSecurity experts know this is unsustainable. Attackers now rely on annoyance itself—flooding victims with approval prompts until they tap “yes” just to stop the buzzing. It’s called MFA fatigue⁸. Friction becomes the vulnerability.\n\nThere’s a better way. Passkeys remove passwords entirely, using cryptographic keys tied to the devices people already hold—already deployed by Apple, Google, Microsoft, and dozens of major platforms⁹. Risk-based authentication watches quietly in the background and intervenes only when something looks genuinely wrong¹⁰—often outperforming human-interrogation systems at scale. Continuous authentication learns your patterns and alerts only when the device stops behaving like you¹¹.\n\nAnd it works. The obstacle isn’t technical—it’s cultural. Friction is cheaper than redesign.\n\nBanks would have to admit that a Malaysian agent reading a question he doesn’t understand over a jittery line isn’t security—it’s ceremony. Streaming platforms would have to admit that digital borders aren’t real borders. Corporations would have to redesign their systems so that suspicion isn’t the default state of the user.\n\nAnna imagines logging in the way she unlocks her phone: one gesture, one breath, no interrogation. David imagines a world where he isn’t forced to decode mangled questions shouted across hemispheres. And I imagine a Saturday when Chase doesn’t call me three times to ask whether I have recently been threatened by Walmart.\n\nThe coffee hisses again. Steam rises in a narrow ribbon. The kitchen is quiet. My phone is still. For a moment, the silence feels like a future no one has built yet—one where not everything requires proving I exist.\n\nThe phone rings. And then, inevitably: “I’m sorry I can’t approve your transaction. Is there anything else I can help you with? Have a nice day.”\n\n***\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1. **Author’s Personal Notes on Chase Bank Interactions, 2025.** The events described involving Chase Bank are factual and based on contemporaneous notes taken by the author during calls at home and conversations at the local Chase branch.
