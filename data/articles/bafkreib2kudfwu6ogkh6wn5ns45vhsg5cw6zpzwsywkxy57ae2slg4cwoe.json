Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\n_Read part one, Full Tank, Fuller Wallet_ _[here](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/full-tank-and-a-full-wallet?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)._\n\n**2. Middle Layer Savings (Third-Party Rebates)**\n\nThis slice is smaller but still meaningful. Apps like [Upside](https://upside.app.link/CRAWFORD2845) bring additional discounts. I earned $26.76 on my primary Upside account, $24.68 on my secondary, and $10.99 on my tertiary, for a total of $62.43 cashed out, with another $3.44 pending since Upside requires a $10 minimum.\n\nThat’s real money layered directly onto my fuel purchases. Upside even used to give a $0.50-per-gallon sign-up bonus (until people abused it—sorry, y’all). Once the app bonuses hit, the final layer of my strategy comes from the cards in my wallet.\n\n**3. Back-End Savings (Cashback Cards)**\n\nMy final layer is the one most people forget: credit card cashback. My Fidelity Visa earns a flat 2% year-round. My Discover It offered 5% cashback on gas and other transit necessities during the third quarter, which spans from July through September.\n\nI earned $14.84 during the quarter and estimate an additional $26.66 from Fidelity across the rest of the year, totaling about $41.50. Because Discover matches your first year’s rewards, that number jumps to $56.34 overall.\n\nEven accounting for a ±$5.63 margin of error due to some tracking issues across cards, that’s still at least $50 in credit card rewards just for fueling up as usual. Eventually, I’d like to get a dedicated fuel and transit card, but that’s an article for another day.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nTdn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee75d2-e8e9-4d29-9cdf-ce7dd10afecb_1184x864.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nTdn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee75d2-e8e9-4d29-9cdf-ce7dd10afecb_1184x864.png)\n\n{{caption:MC PRIME}}\n\n### The Big Picture\n\nSo what does all this mean? In a single year of tracking\\[1], I saved 25% compared to the state average on prices at the pump alone, along with:\n\n* $65.87 in app rebates.\n\n* Added another $50+ in credit card rewards.\n\n* And grabbed $50+ in loyalty discounts not applied at the pump.\n\nAdd it up, and that’s roughly $165+ in rewards and $500 in under-market fuel costs, a total benefit of over $600 from simply paying attention.\n\nEven if you don’t drive as much as I do, and you probably don’t, $100 in savings can still grow into more than $5,000 when put to work, just like we talked about in the [25–500 Plan](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true). It’s proof that Benjamin Franklin’s old saying, _“a penny saved is a penny earned,”_ still holds today—only now it’s measured in thousands instead of cents.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n449!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0ca61fc-78ef-4197-aa28-62a50b34b939_2370x1380.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n449!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0ca61fc-78ef-4197-aa28-62a50b34b939_2370x1380.png)\n\n{{caption:Turn your yearly gas savings now into an annual vacation when you retire!}}\n\n***\n\n\\[1] [PDF of every fill-up, which includes only front-end savings](https://1drv.ms/b/c/98b3061f2874d8cf/Eeip6uwjSuRGhPlFyHTugH8BNQB4Jw160ui1NrvSOLkWwg?e=KNVhto)\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
