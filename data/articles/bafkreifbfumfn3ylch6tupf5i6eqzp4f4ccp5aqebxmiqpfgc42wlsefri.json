Dawn was just thinning the darkness, and winter’s freeze still whispered from the curbs. Suzanne Jennings, 65, stood in line, thumb hooked in her denim jacket pocket, her red “Trump 2024: The Sequel” cap pulled low. She told a reporter from The Guardian, “I totally believe he loves America. He loves us and he’s doing it.¹¹ Her voice wasn’t loud. It was quiet enough that you could hear the hum of nearby cars, the wind rising off the lot. But it lingered. Nodding faces in the crowd made it into a wave. In that moment you could see the faith and risk in equal measure.\n\nThat was how dreams begin: ordinary streets, familiar sounds, until something small tilts reality. Neuroscientist Erik Hoel calls it the overfitted brain, a state in which the mind learns its world too precisely and stops adapting. Dreams, he argues, are the system’s correction: bursts of dissonance that shake us out of complacency. America, in 2025, feels caught in one of its own. Hoel once wrote that dreams exist to increase generalizability via corrupted sensory inputs.² In plainer terms: an overfitted brain mistakes familiarity for truth.\n\nBy Day One of his return to power, President Trump began rewiring the machinery. He revived “Schedule F” — the classification that reassigns career civil servants as at‑will political staff. He ordered the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices across agencies.¹ Within days, the federal bureaucracy’s spine was flexing. The news came like static: crackling, brief, hard to place, until the pattern emerged.\n\nIn Wheeling, West Virginia, the midday cold held onto the brick square. At a protest near the old First State Capitol, a grandmother in a red scarf held a sign: I am afraid for my grandchildren. Beside her, a former state senator said quietly, with a hardness that catches in your throat: the dismantling of DEI is economic genocide for Black communities.³ The air smelled of wood‑smoke and wet leaves. Voices echoed off the courthouse façade. The protest had no cameras, no celebrities — just Tuesday tension and small‑town worry.\n\nFrom there, the view widened abruptly, like in dreams.\n\nAt Marine Corps Base Quantico, nearly eight hundred top‑ranking officers assembled in pressed uniforms beneath the filtered light of a government auditorium. Trump walked in. He told them, we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military. We’re under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms.⁴ The line didn’t thunder. It chilled. Officers sat rigid, glancing sideways, unsure whether applause was called for or rebellion was being named.\n\nIt was a moment ripped from dream logic: compression, symbolism, threat blurred with theater. And just as in dreams, the absurdity felt real. The line didn’t need to make sense. It needed to stick.\n\nIn Portland, Oregon, the morning mist clung to coffee lids and bike seats. Business leader Andrew Hoan, standing outside city hall, tried to reset the tone: peace and calm — this city depends on both.⁵ Governor Tina Kotek followed, calling the president’s rhetoric a manufactured narrative.⁶ They spoke not to elevate tension but to anchor the conversation. The air smelled of fresh rain and roasted beans. You could imagine someone two blocks away hearing their voices drift from a car radio, unsure whether to nod or switch the station.\n\nChicago came next, not because of sequence but because dreams favor symbol over timeline. On a South Side stoop, two neighbors argued. One said Guard patrols would bring order. The other shook his head. It feels like occupation. That day’s paper quoted a federal judge: no credible evidence of domestic insurgency to justify deployment.⁷ The next morning’s paper showed the troops anyway.\n\nBack in Macomb, the red hats blazed like poppies in frost. Jennings stood at the edge of the lot, scanning the slow‑motion swirl of a departing crowd. They didn’t quote manifestos; they passed thermoses, they waved flags in the cold. I totally believe he loves America, she said again. It wasn’t assertion. It was muscle memory.\n\nBut the dream, Hoel reminds us, is not safety. Sleep loss, specifically the loss of dreams, leads to an overfitted brain that fails to generalize.⁸ The very weirdness of dreams is what makes them useful. Disruption teaches flexibility. Repetition calcifies.\n\nBehind the scenes, the structure was hardening. The Project 2025 blueprint, published by The Heritage Foundation and more than 100 conservative organizations, outlined a plan to concentrate executive power, eliminate entire departments, and rewrite the legal spine of government.⁹ Its precision, with every clause and contingency, reads like policy overfitted to ideology. Kevin Roberts, the group’s president, said it clearly: we are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it.¹⁰\n\nTo the rallygoers in Macomb County, that line never arrived. Their America wasn’t built from blueprints. It lived in dinner‑table stories, Saturday errands, the half‑truths of Facebook scrolls. It lived in belief: raw, urgent, unexamined.\n\nAnd to you?\n\nTo the nurse in Pittsburgh, the teacher in Peoria, and the father of three in Flagstaff, the policy tremors may feel distant.\n\nUntil they don’t.\n\nUntil the reading list changes. Until your passport takes longer. Until your agency is gone. Until the Guard drives past your window.\n\nThat’s the dream logic. The shift happens.\n\nThen you try to remember when it began.\n\nWhen the jolt reaches your street, you count the signs. You listen to your neighbor. You watch the machine. You check the locks. You scan the mail. You weigh the hum of engines and the silence of ballots, the flags in the frost, the breath on your windshield before dawn.\n\nThe wind off the lot is colder now.\n\nThe crowd is thinning.\n\nThe machine still hums.\n\nDreams, Hoel reminds us, end only when we remember we’re dreaming.\n\nWill you wake?\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\. **Federal Register.** _Restoring Accountability to Policy‑Influencing Positions_, Executive Order 14151 (2025).
