That was me two weeks ago, sprinting toward the Amtrak station, hoping to make the 5 PM train. My light rail connection, the Lynx Blue Line, had left without me, even after Google Maps swore I had more time. Nothing humbles you like watching public transit roll away as you sprint toward it, waving your hands like a lunatic.\n\nLearning to control only what I can has become a running theme since starting college. Rowdy dorm parties at 2 AM. Professors who think Canvas due dates shouldn’t be 11:59 PM (which is insane). And public transit that apparently runs on vibes instead of written schedules. But nowhere has this lesson mattered more than with my investments.\n\nLast week in _[Mastering the Apple Card](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/from-cookies-and-cream-to-the-walled?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, we discussed how Apple’s cashback and 0% financing make it a critical addition to my wallet. This week is about controlling what’s in our power to change.\n\nWars, interest rate cycles, and random market swings are entirely out of our hands. Trust me, I’ve tried everything from a crystal ball to buying shares at my lucky time (10:14 AM). Nothing smooths volatility. But as investors, there are two things under our control. Fees, meaning the expense ratios on the funds we own, and taxes, meaning how much of our gains go straight to the government.\n\nBoth can be changed through thoughtful decisions and considerate planning. This week, we’re highlighting how fees drag on long-term returns and how choosing the right investments can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary management costs.\n\nImagine starting a new job and being handed an investor packet for your employer’s retirement plan. The menu is full of mutual funds, the old-school “reliable” option. Mutual funds are just pools of investor money that a professional manager uses to buy stocks, bonds, and other assets. You get diversification without having to build the portfolio yourself. One fund on the list, [The Growth Fund of America](https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/investments/fund/agthx), proudly displays a 10-year average annual return of 14.28%, which beats long-term S\\&P 500 averages of 10% by a mile. Everything looks great except for one detail. The expense ratio. It’s 0.59%.\n\nAfter digging, you notice that its top holdings — Nvidia, Google, Broadcom, Microsoft, Meta — look almost identical to the S\\&P 500’s top holdings. Not a perfect match, but similar enough to compare. So you put it against [SPYM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/state-street-spdr-portfolio-sp-500-etf-spym?WT.mc_id=ps_etf-lcc_low-cost-core-funds_us_google_text_psb_mf2_spym_oct25\\&gclsrc=aw.ds\\&gad_source=1\\&gad_campaignid=1866111105\\&gbraid=0AAAAACz5AuNEu1yx2K2MstmpY_FuHb5Zr\\&gclid=CjwKCAiAxc_JBhA2EiwAFVs7XJsABw5y0rH6941LvcaLN9XCL9ajvrs1W6QMdD3FFg9LOxYhmhCrihoC7D8QAvD_BwE), a low-cost ETF that tracks the [S\\&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day, unlike mutual funds, which only trade once per day. Still, functionally, they’re just baskets of companies, the same idea as mutual funds, but often with fewer managers and middlemen. The S\\&P 500 has a 10-year annualized return of 14.58%, which is actually slightly better than the mutual fund’s, and its top holdings are basically the same.\n\nSo why does the ETF make you $215,000 wealthier by retirement?\n\nThe ETF’s expense ratio is 0.02%. The mutual fund’s is 0.59%. That’s a .57 point difference. For every $100 you invest, you pay 59 cents a year for the mutual fund and 2 cents a year for the ETF. Expenses are deducted from the fund’s profits, not paid directly by investors.\n\nLayer that seemingly small difference on top of compounding, and the numbers explode. Over 10 years, that gap costs you $156 for every $1,000 invested. Over 25 years, it’s $4,805. By retirement, the fee totals roughly $215,000, which is paid to the fund manager rather than to you.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2HUu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fd09dce-5f54-4c16-b5e9-f5b27b9efd23_2720x1568.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2HUu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fd09dce-5f54-4c16-b5e9-f5b27b9efd23_2720x1568.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:The Cost of Fees: ETF vs. Mutual Fund Return Over Time, starting with $1,000}}\n\nTwo comparable portfolios. Two completely different outcomes. The only difference is cost.\n\nWhy do people still choose the mutual fund? Because many don’t realize the impact of fees. There’s a reason those funds are advertised under the employer’s investment plan: part of those fees often gets kicked back to the employer. That mutual fund wasn’t designed with your best interest in mind.\n\nI ended up taking an Uber to the Amtrak station. I took control of what I could instead of hoping transit would magically align with my schedule. As investors, we owe ourselves the same mindset. Know what you’re paying. Know whether it’s worth it. And know the cost of being wrong.\n\n_Next week, we’ll shift to the other factor investors can control: how tax-efficient choices can shape your entire financial future._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
