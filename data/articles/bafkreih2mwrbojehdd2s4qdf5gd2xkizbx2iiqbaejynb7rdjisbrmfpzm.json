  "body": "Last Friday, I went to a roundtable hosted by a couple of well-regarded philanthropic/ media/ convening organizations.[1] This particular gathering was on the topic of [Effective Altruism, or EA for short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism): How to bridge between EA, Silicon Valley, and pre-existing power centers (they didn’t describe it using these words), and what might philosophically come next after EA (this was the explicit topic). It was governed by the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule), so I can tell you some of what was discussed, but not who said it.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!caIW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019e0fb1-3afb-4511-b666-13c96c617a72_248x248.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!caIW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019e0fb1-3afb-4511-b666-13c96c617a72_248x248.png)\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot lately about EA, and I guess a lot of other people have been, too. EA is primarily associated with the rationalist subculture. For readers who are already familiar with rationalism and EA, it would probably be helpful if I first situate myself in relation to them (if you know nothing about these subcultures, don’t try to understand this paragraph, just skip to the next one). My relationship to the rationalist world has always been funny: I generally like rationalists, and I also have some major disagreements and critiques, and yet I seem to fit in oddly well notwithstanding those disagreements. From 2008-2012 I had a [popular sex-positive feminist blog](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/a-couple-of-my-old-books-in-pdf), which for a while was the only feminist blog on the LessWrong blogroll (I didn’t put it there). After I moved full-time to SF in 2013, I did things like go to early EA Global events, and I dated some rationalists, and I lived in [co-living spaces](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/my-life-in-the-co-living-scene-and) where some members were rationalists. More recently, when I try to explain to people that I don’t exactly think of myself as a rationalist, they are like: ‘You have a fourteen-year-old LessWrong account and you regularly give talks and attend events at Lighthaven, so what are you talking about?’ Which is fair! But I feel the need to specify that I appear to have very significant cognitive and cultural differences compared to most rationalists, and I’m not just saying this out of a stigma-driven social urge to separate myself from the community (I realize that many people try to dissociate from these movements, but I don’t care if the broader public thinks of me as a rationalist); I am, rather, saying this because people often make mistaken inferences about my opinions and beliefs when I don’t specify this distinction up front. For example, I believe in God and magic and miracles, which most rationalists very much don’t.\n\nFrom my point of view, rationalism and EA are unusually effective social movements that are loosely based in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, but there are lots of others. For instance, if you feel like digging into Burning Man as a phenomenon, including its history, I have [this piece](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/burning-man-2012-the-directors-cut) about it and I’m happy to answer questions; it is a subject I know a lot about. Another social movement frequently mentioned during the event on Friday was the so-called “tech right,” [where I’ve also spent some time](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/why-i-was-part-of-the-neoreactionary).\\[2] With that said, I think we can note important characteristics that distinguish EA from others.\n\n[Read more](https://lydialaurenson.substack.com/p/the-future-of-effective-altruism)\n\n***\n\nThank you for reading Solar Light.
