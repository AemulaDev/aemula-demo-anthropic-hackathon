As I run the race of a young man of God, I’m reminded daily of the same truth. Self-discipline isn’t optional; it’s essential. Temptations fly toward me faster than any Olympic runner, and without spiritual conditioning, I’d never keep pace.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 9, Paul lays out what it means to live with both discipline and purpose as you serve God while also calling the body of Christ to provide for God’s workers. Just as athletes pursue victory through rigorous training, Christlikeness is to be pursued by us with the same intensity and focus. I might not spend six hours a day in the gym, but I do have the opportunity to train my mind, taking my thoughts captive, maintain quality quiet times, and devote my heart fully to the Lord.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MTKv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6b806c8-a6f8-4aaa-9279-1ee4e50b45c6_1536x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MTKv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6b806c8-a6f8-4aaa-9279-1ee4e50b45c6_1536x1024.png)\n\n**1 Corinthians 9:6 (NIV)**\n\n_Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?_\n\nIn verse 6, he highlights the right to work for a living, to take a wife, and to receive the basics of bread and water. These are not luxuries, but simple, God-given provisions.\n\n**1 Corinthians 9:9 (NIV)**\n\n_For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned?_\n\nVerses 10–12 remind us that we have the right to share the Gospel and to take joy in seeing the fruit of our labor. When we pour into others spiritually, it’s natural to desire a positive outcome from that work. In addition, he requests that those who have been ministered to willfully and joyfully give toward his and Barnabas’ ministry.\n\n**1 Corinthians 9:14 (NIV)**\n\n_In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the Gospel should receive their living from the Gospel._\n\nVerse 14 makes it very clear that God commands those who preach the Gospel to receive their livelihood from it. For Paul and Barnabas, this meant relying on the Lord for daily provision rather than earthly stability from worldly ways of living. Paul emphasizes the provision made for the Levites who served in the Temple. He draws on the Corinthians’ knowledge of the Old Testament to support his viewpoint, showing his ability to share the Gospel in ways familiar to the cultures he immerses himself in.\n\n**1 Corinthians 9:16 (NIV)**\n\n_For when I preach the Gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel!_\n\nIn verses 16–17, Paul speaks from deep conviction. He says he feels compelled to preach the Gospel, not out of obligation, but out of love. We, too, are encouraged to serve God of our own accord. Paul’s conviction to go so far as to say “Woe is Me” forces me to confront instances in my on-campus life where I have the opportunity to not only display God’s love but also show the good news by bringing out my Bible, something I far too often struggle to do out of fear of others’ opinions and reactions.\n\n\\*\\*1 Corinthians 9:23–24 (NIV)\n\\*\\*\\_I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.\n\\__Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize._\n\nVerses 19–23 show Paul’s adaptability. He maneuvered himself into different cultural settings so he could reach people where they were. He met them in the middle by learning their customs, understanding their struggles, and adjusting his approach to save everyone.\n\nVerse 24 ties it all together: run the race to win the prize. To do that, we need self-discipline. Faith without spiritual conditioning quickly fades.\n\nGroup reflections reminded me that not everyone matures right in front of our eyes. Sometimes all we can do is plant the seed and trust God to bring it to life.\n\nIn verses 20–21, Paul reaches people on their level, showing humility and flexibility. In verse 11, he speaks of reaping a spiritual harvest, a reminder that a minister should be supported by those they serve. This connects to verse 18, where Paul talks about preaching the Gospel free of charge. God’s grace and mercy are gifts, not wages. To put it bluntly, we aren’t owed squat from God. That’s why, as the body of Christ, we must support those who dedicate their lives to witnessing.\n\nVerse 9 references Deuteronomy 25:4\\_“Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”\\_ This isn’t about teaching the Gospel for money, but about the fairness of receiving support.\n\nVerses 19–23 again emphasize Paul’s willingness to live under the law while ministering to Jews who did so. He was fully committed to giving up whatever it took to glorify God and spread the good news.\n\nVerse 18 shows Paul’s frugality in the Lord, working on a shoestring budget, trusting that God would provide. In verse 14, we see again that he had a right to make an income from preaching, but he didn’t do it for wages. He didn’t even get compensated for it anyway.\n\nMatthew 6 reminds us that the lilies and flowers don’t worry about the future, and neither should we. The Lord will bring provision in His timing.\n\n\\*\\*1 Corinthians 9:26–27 (NIV)\n\\*\\*_Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.\nNo, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize._\n\nVerse 27 challenges us to get our bodies under control, to use them for God’s glory, not our own pleasure. This connects to the fruit of the Spirit, especially self-control. Verse 26 carries a heavy emphasis on purity and repentance, particularly in the area of sexual sin.\n\nJust like an Olympic athlete trains for years—or even decades—we’re called to maintain the strictest standards in the spiritual realm. The little, daily decisions either build or destroy our faith.\n\nRunning the race requires an end goal. Spiritually, that goal is sanctification now and eternal treasure later.\n\nWhy wake up at 7 a.m. to lift? Why say no to temptation or comfort? Because if we truly love Jesus and are working toward Christlikeness, sacrifice becomes a joy, even when it isn’t easy.\n\nWe can’t live trapped in doubt about our salvation. We experience salvation through grace. We aren’t doomed if we mess up, but we should feel an urgency to pursue sanctification.\n\nWe must embrace the grace He purchased for us on the cross. While we are not perfect, we achieve redemption through repentance.\n\n_Paul calls us to run the race to win the prize, so see you on the track. Until next time:_\n\n**“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.” — Matthew 6:28 (NIV)**\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
