Tourists drift between T-shirts, tricorne hats, and granite plaques, unaware that the stones beneath their feet once held Patuxet. Its outline remains—not visible, but traceable through time. A smear of red paint clings to the base of the monument, dry but not yet faded. From the top of the hill, a drum begins. A voice follows—part chant, part warning: _When you feast on our tablecloth, you dine on stolen land._ The phrase has echoed through Day of Mourning gatherings since 1970.\n\nThey were told they were entering wilderness. But the settlers of 1620 arrived in the aftermath of devastation. For three years before their landing, an epidemic—possibly leptospirosis or viral hepatitis—swept the coastal Indigenous communities. Entire villages collapsed. In some, only one in ten survived.¹ Crops rotted. Many bodies went unburied. To the English, it looked like providence. To the Wampanoag, it was the edge of survival.\n\nThey mistook the silence of catastrophe for peace.\n\nThis was no untouched land. Before European contact, what is now the continental United States held between 2.5 and 7 million Indigenous people across hundreds of distinct nations.² In the Northeast, confederacies like the Wampanoag, Massachusett, and Nipmuc spoke related Algonquian dialects, traded along rivers and coastlines, and negotiated shifting borders. A 2025 demographic study based on radiocarbon evidence found dense riverine and coastal settlements through the early 1600s.³\n\nAt the modern Patuxet Homesite, Wampanoag educators light cooking fires inside traditional wetus, surrounded by schoolchildren in windbreakers and baseball caps. One interpreter, her hands blackened from smoke, gestures to the cedar-framed roof and says: _They didn’t begin the story. They arrived in the middle of ours._\n\nBy autumn 1621, half of the colonists had died. They gathered a modest harvest. According to Edward Winslow’s brief account—just over a hundred words—ninety Wampanoag men arrived bearing five deer.⁴ For three days, the groups shared food. Muskets were fired. The Wampanoag watched. The Narragansett to the west, untouched by the plague, remained a threat. Ousamequin, the Wampanoag sachem, saw the English not as kin but as a temporary buffer.\n\nThe feast was a firebreak. Not a festival.\n\nThe danger of myth is not only in what it claims, but in what it silences.\n\nLong before the Pilgrims imagined a harvest rite, Norse explorers from Greenland landed on the northern edge of the continent. Around 1000 A.D., they built sod-walled halls at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland—evidence confirmed through excavation and carbon dating.⁵ The settlements were temporary. Conflict with Native occupants likely contributed to their retreat.\n\nAcross the continent, at different moments, Cahokia rose along the Mississippi. Around 1050 A.D., it stood at its peak—a city of mounds, observatories, and ceremonial plazas. Its population rivaled London’s.⁶ Burials held copper from the Great Lakes and shellwork finer than European lace.\n\nThese weren’t scattered bands. They were planners, astronomers, diplomats—ordered societies that shaped their world through law, ceremony, agriculture, and memory.\n\nStill, the story that stuck belonged to the settlers. In 1841, New England minister Alexander Young published Winslow’s letter and appended a title never used in 1621: “The First Thanksgiving.”⁷ Later, during the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday—a myth of unity forged in the fire of fracture. It stuck.\n\nGratitude and violence have long danced in uneasy rhythm. In 1637, after English soldiers and Native allies massacred over 400 Pequot people at Mystic, Connecticut, Governor John Winthrop declared a day of thanksgiving for the “victory.”⁸ Gratitude, in America, has never been apolitical.\n\nEarlier still, in 1565, Spanish settlers and the Timucua shared a meal after Catholic mass in what is now St. Augustine, Florida—forty years before the Mayflower.⁹ Thanksgiving, in this sense, is not a founding act. It’s a lens. And lenses obscure as much as they reveal.\n\nNear Plymouth Rock, a young woman wrapped in a Wampanoag flag—frayed at the hem, blue stitching against crimson—watches as tourists pose before the granite. Some crouch, some smile, some hold selfie sticks overhead. She doesn’t move. Her stillness interrupts the scene—not loud, not angry, but firm. _They say we vanished. But we are still here. Still watching. Still remembering._\n\nGranite insists on permanence. But memory travels lighter.\n\nToday, the institution once called Plimoth Plantation is now Plimoth Patuxet Museums. It includes Wampanoag interpreters, exhibits on pre-contact life, and Indigenous curation.¹⁰ Above the harbor, each November, activists read aloud the suppressed words of Wamsutta James—the Mashpee Wampanoag whose 1970 speech was banned from the official 350th Pilgrim anniversary.¹¹ He had written: _History wants us to believe the Indian was a savage, illiterate, uncivilized animal—a history that cannot be obscured by books or buried beneath the soil._\n\nMassachusett, the language once spoken here, is being revived after more than a century without native speakers. It is taught again to children. The words, once silenced, have returned to breath. _When you feast on our tablecloth, you dine on stolen land._\n\n\\*\\*“Kꝏche nuwônatamun, wutche punawâw ohke.”\\*\\*¹²\n\nThe danger of the Thanksgiving story is not its falsehood, but its instruction—that silence can be mistaken for peace.\n\nThanksgiving endures because it offers comfort—a meal, a prayer, a beginning. But beginnings are rarely clean. A former tribal chair, speaking in 2021, put it plainly: _The story isn’t ours until we get to tell it._\n\nThe wind stirs again off the harbor—salt, smoke, wet stone. Tourists check their phones. The red paint on the monument has begun to fade. But the drum on the hill beats steady beneath the gulls. And in that rhythm—faint, unbroken—the outline of Patuxet still speaks, not carved in stone, but carried on the wind.\n\n⸻\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1\\. David S.
