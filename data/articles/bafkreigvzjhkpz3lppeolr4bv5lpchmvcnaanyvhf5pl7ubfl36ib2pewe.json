As the dust cleared, regulators, investors, and executives were forced to confront what had really caused Silicon Valley Bank to implode and what it meant for everyone else._\n\nThree days later, Credit Suisse’s rival UBS acquired it for over three billion, a bargain compared to its six Billion value the week prior. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced the government’s commitment to protect depositors at all insured banks. First Citizens Bank later announced its purchase of many of SVB’s remaining assets for over $16 billion, including deposits of over $115 billion and loans of $72 billion.\n\nThe aftermath of SVB’s collapse continues to impact the banking industry as regulators enact new laws and regulations to prevent such failures. The root causes of SVB’s collapse are twofold. Firstly, negligence was evident within the bank and among regulators. SVB lacked a chief risk officer for eight months in 2022, and holding bonds during high inflation and an interest rate hiking cycle was a wrong decision. Inept leadership serves as the second catalyst for the collapse. The top executives failed to diversify investments and maintain sufficient cash reserves as market conditions tightened.\n\nThe leadership’s lack of experience in managing a bank with hundreds of billions in assets has raised concerns about the qualifications of top leaders. While diversity in leadership is valuable, qualifications should take precedence over race or gender. In hindsight, more attention to portfolio diversification instead of managerial diversity could have mitigated the crisis. The rise and fall of Silicon Valley Bank is an example of what success could look like, as well as the consequences of complacency.\n\n_SVB’s story isn’t just about one bank’s failure—it’s about what happens when confidence, competence, and caution all vanish at once. In the end, its collapse is a reminder that even the most innovative institutions can crumble when they forget the basics of sound banking._\n\n_Thanks for reading through the entire five-part series. I hope it left you with a clearer picture of how quickly even the biggest players can fall._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
