  "body": "One of the practices I generally want to encourage in my articles on Substack is critical thinking.\n\nThis doesn’t make me too different from anyone else; I think everyone would agree that critical thinking is a skill we should all develop and use regularly.\n\nBut how can we tell if someone is thinking critically instead of accepting (or rejecting) claims at face value?\n\nI had given this a bit of thought after a brief exchange on Substack about a week ago about what is needed for critical thinking.\n\nThe most basic test for whether someone is thinking critically about a given claim is whether they have said the following four words about that claim, either to themselves or to others:\n\n**“That might be wrong.”**\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z9m_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb44be8f-ddfa-4a14-89ff-9de67d11291c_1920x1080.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z9m_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb44be8f-ddfa-4a14-89ff-9de67d11291c_1920x1080.png)\n\nIt might not be precisely those four words, but there is an element of skepticism involved in critical thinking that is only set aside with proper justification of the claim in question. If there has been no skepticism regarding a claim, can we be sure that critical thinking has taken place? I don’t think so.\n\nBut someone might ask: how can we determine if claims are right or wrong without using other claims we know to be right to justify the claims in question? In other words, we can’t think critically about everything, nor should we: we have to start somewhere with facts that most people can agree upon.\n\nBut we don’t agree on everything, and false and unproven claims are everywhere, not to mention claims that have truth mixed with falsehood. As such, we ought to express some level of skepticism about many of the claims that we run across in our day-to-day lives. This, of course, applies to many of the claims we hold to most dearly; _they might be wrong_, _too._ This does not mean they _are_ wrong, but in thinking critically, we entertain that possibility, at least until we can justify those claims to our satisfaction.\n\nThis sort of justification is hard and slow. It requires us to consider alternatives we might not have thought about before, and it also forces us to consider that a given claim may be right in one context and wrong in another. But in doing all of these things, we gain understanding of ourselves and the world around us, and we become more secure in our convictions and more effective in persuading others.",
