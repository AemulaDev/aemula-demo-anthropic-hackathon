Coffee in hand, not cooking yet—just taking inventory. The house was quiet in that rare, cooperative way, the kind that makes you feel like the day hasn’t started asking things of you yet.\n\nWe’re staying in tonight. Partly because eating out has drifted into hedge-fund territory, but mostly because cooking at home still makes sense to me. You start with ingredients. You apply heat. You wait. The system responds. That kind of honesty is harder to find than it used to be.\n\nWe collected ingredients yesterday, when you could still make it through the checkout lines in finite time. Garlic, ginger, scallions, chicken, rice. Dinner will be sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, plus steamed dumplings and scallion pancakes—these last two courtesy of Costco, which remains one of the few places where efficiency hasn’t been declared unpatriotic.\n\nOn the counter nearby sat a couple of bottles acquired years ago, before tariffs turned arithmetic into an emotional experience. They aren’t rare. They aren’t special. They’re just still here. Patient. Which feels instructive.\n\n_**Christmas doesn’t solve anything. It just slows the world down long enough to remember what still works.**_\n\nWe’ll be with family tomorrow. We’ll talk around the usual fault lines, laugh at stories we all pretend we haven’t memorized, and eat more than planned. None of this will be new. That’s the point.\n\nI don’t know what next year brings. I hope it will be 3000% better than this one. I’ve lived long enough to distrust confident forecasts. But I do know that tonight people will gather, food will be cooked, and for a few hours the noise will stay outside where it belongs.\n\nThe coffee is still warm. Dinner prep is still ahead of us.\n\nThat feels like a decent way to begin Christmas Eve—and maybe a better year.",
