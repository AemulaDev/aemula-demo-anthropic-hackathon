The Center is especially relevant now as its funding and recent federal policy shifts are squeezing the budgets of the Center and its partner nonprofits._\n\nOn the evening of January 17th, I found myself racing against the clock to complete my essays for the Bank of America Student Leaders program. Although I had heard great things about the program and knew someone who had participated the year before, I didn't fully understand what I was getting into. In April, after receiving an email notifying me that I was a semifinalist, a local BofA representative interviewed me by phone. During this interview, I began to grasp the incredible opportunity ahead as a potential Student Leader. Ultimately, I was selected to represent the Coastal North Carolina market.\n\nOver the next seven weeks, I was privileged with the opportunity to work at the Harrelson Center in downtown Wilmington. The Center has a team of eleven staff members who handle administrative and logistical tasks that support partner nonprofits. Jo Ann Carter Harrelson, a member of First Baptist Church, located next door, was diagnosed with cancer in the early 2000s and envisioned a final gift to her beloved community by transforming the next-door former county jail into a hub for local benefit. Since then, the Center has grown exponentially, increasing its impact yearly; it is now home to twenty nonprofits focused on humanitarian work. The Center provides nonprofit partners with educational resources, marketing support, volunteer recruitment, collaborative spaces, and below-market rent.\n\nThree years ago, the Center began partnering with the BofA Student Leaders program, offering rising high school seniors and college freshmen the chance to learn about local issues and develop skills to serve their communities better. On my first day at the Harrelson Center, the staff attended an off-campus meeting at Eden Village, which opened my eyes to the homelessness crisis in the Cape Fear Region. Wilmington has over 500 chronically unhoused individuals, many of whom struggle with substance abuse, PTSD, or other long-term challenges that make maintaining stable housing difficult. Eden Village is one of only two communities in the United States offering 600-square-foot homes in a secure, enclosed environment. Each of the 31 homes is fully furnished and funded by local individuals, businesses, or churches.\n\nFrom Soaring as Eagles, a pre-K development program for disadvantaged youth, to LINC, which supports individuals transitioning from incarceration back into society, the Harrelson Center offers essential resources to many in the Port City. Despite thinking I knew the area well and being familiar with local organizations and resources, I was unaware of the Center's extensive efforts. The Help Hub was one of the most enlightening programs I worked with; it provides emergency services to those who risk losing utilities like power or water or facing eviction due to unforeseen circumstances. For example, I witnessed an individual who had fallen ill, lost her job, and was $200 short of keeping power and water on. The Help Hub stepped in, paying the utility company directly and offering a \"hand up\" rather than a handout.\n\nIn mid-July, days before the first major hurricane of the season, I attended the hurricane management and disaster training session at the New Hanover County Emergency Operations Center, designed to withstand a Category Five hurricane. Over thirty organizations, including government agencies, the Harrelson Center, local churches, and nonprofits, came together to plan for hurricanes and manage crises. Seeing this collaboration firsthand was insightful, reinforcing how well-prepared the county and its partners are for natural disasters.\n\nI experienced high-level government in Washington, DC, during the leadership summit organized by BofA. My revelation was how much impact an individual can make by dedicating just a few hours each month to volunteering. I wrote over $100,000 worth of grants, including funds for The Help Hub and an emergency generator for the Center. While I have not yet seen the results of these grants, I remain optimistic that my hard work will meaningfully impact my community and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to work at The Harrelson Center.\n\n_Looking back, I saw firsthand how the Harrelson Center quietly holds Wilmington together. Today, those same nonprofits (and more!) are fighting to keep the lights on, a challenge Director Meade Van Pelt captured powerfully in a recent_ _[op-ed](https://www.wilmingtonbiz.com/wilmingtonbiz_magazine/2025/06/16/opinion_minding_the_widening_gap/26627). My summer may be over, but the need for community support is only growing._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
