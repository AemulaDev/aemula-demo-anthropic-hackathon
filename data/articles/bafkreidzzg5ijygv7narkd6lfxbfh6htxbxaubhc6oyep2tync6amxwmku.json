  "body": "Encouraging true critical thinking involves risk.\n\nSpecifically, the risk that each of us might be wrong, and that others will inform us of our error.\n\nBut that’s a risk worth taking, and the reward is worth it.\n\nWe’re all wrong about something; we probably don’t know it yet. If we are fortunate, we discover our error and correct it.\n\nIn the article below, I describe how skepticism is essential to critical thinking and why this is needed in a world rife with false and unproven claims.\n\n[A four-word test for critical thinking](https://genejoy.substack.com/p/a-four-word-test-for-critical-thinking)\n\nThe risk that we take with encouraging critical thinking is that others will find holes in our reasoning that we didn’t notice, either because our reasoning was motivated to avoid noticing those holes or because we just didn’t take time to think about them. Either way, we should realize that having someone else tell us we missed something is a gift.\n\nBut what if we’re actually right? If that is the case, then we have an opportunity to explain our reasoning and help others to understand how we arrived at the position we hold. In both cases, everyone wins: we learn things today that we did not know yesterday.\n\nI am convinced that if a person isn’t willing to be shown that he or she is wrong in some area, then that person doesn’t really want others to think critically; instead, they want others to conform to their own thinking, to fall into line. This blinds people to possible sources of error that can affect their reasoning. The sources of error are still there, and others may very well notice them, but those who insist that they are right won’t consider them. The person who closes their eyes won’t see other people, but that doesn’t stop other people from seeing them.\n\nLet’s take the risk that someone will point out errors in our reasoning. The reward is well worth it.",
