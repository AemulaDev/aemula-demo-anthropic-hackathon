Today, we start at the beginning, when a poker game and a wild idea helped launch what became the favorite bank of the tech world._\n\nIn 1982, Silicon Valley emerged as the global hub for startups, specifically in the technology sector. Household names today, such as Apple, IBM, and Intel, were newcomers to the region and pioneered its growth. One evening, during a poker game, Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis conceived the idea of a bank that would provide capital to startups and serve as an ideal place to park their funds.\n\nFast forward to 1988, and Silicon Valley Bank went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Just eight years later, it expanded its presence to fifteen states. The early 2000s brought challenges with the Dot-com bubble and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Still, by early 2008, SVB made strides across the United States and established its first international office in Israel. Meanwhile, the financial crisis temporarily halted growth at the decade's end. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the bank made a remarkable comeback, opening its first UK branch in 2012 and expanding to Ireland and Germany by 2018. It also made strategic acquisitions, including Boston Private and West River Group. The bank was thriving, attracting corporate founders at an astonishing pace.\n\nIn 2019, the first cracks began to appear. The Federal Reserve, responsible for maintaining low inflation and regulating banks, issued a statement highlighting concerns about SVB. No one knew that this seemingly minuscule citation would mark the beginning of the end for the United States' 16th-largest bank.\n\n_SVB had spent decades turning a poker-table idea into a global powerhouse, but momentum can hide fragility. Next time, we will witness the Fed's warning slip out to the public eye as COVID-19 overwhelmed the world and left SVB caught in the storm with nowhere to hide._\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
