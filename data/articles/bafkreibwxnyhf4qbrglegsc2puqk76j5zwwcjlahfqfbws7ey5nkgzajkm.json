Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nWhen I was a kid and had chores to do, my mom would pay me one penny for each chore completed. Things like vacuuming, sweeping, and picking up the random stuff on my floor helped me save a little money. Looking back, I feel like I should’ve unionized with my brother to negotiate for better pay. Although that’s one small example of cash, or in that case a singular coin, today I very rarely deal with coins or even physical money at all.\n\nLast week in _[“So, you got kicked off your parents data plan…”,](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/so-you-finally-got-kicked-from-your?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_ we discussed how to save money while keeping the phone plan you actually need, all while cutting costs as much as possible.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to build and maintain wealth is by holding your cash effectively. Although I used to keep a piggy bank full of chore dollars and later lemonade stand profits under my bed, I soon learned that wasn’t a very practical or safe way to hold my money, as my brother “borrowed” a few bucks to buy gum and candy bars.\n\nRecently, while checking my PNC savings account, I noticed it paid 0.01% APY. APY stands for annual percentage yield, or the amount of money the bank pays me per year for the right to use my money for their business operations. Unless you have millions of dollars, 0.01% won’t do much for you. But by learning how to hold your cash more effectively, you can earn much more than a pitiful penny, and you don’t even have to vacuum your room for it.\n\nCash is much more than just physical bills. Virtual dollars in your checking account or savings account, high-yield savings accounts (HYSA), money market funds (MMF), and short-term debt issued by the federal government, known as Treasury bills (T-bills), are all considered cash and cash equivalents. For an investment or account to be classified as a cash equivalent, it must be highly liquid. Liquidity is how quickly you can turn an asset into usable cash without losing value, which matters when rent is due, your car needs repairs, or an unexpected bill arrives.\n\nMoney market funds issue shares, but each share has a set price of $1. The fund uses investor dollars to buy short-term federal government debt, which it in turn uses to finance its operations. The government can issue debt for as short a term as four weeks up to 30 years. But anything between one and three months is considered cash-like because it is so easy to buy and sell on the open market. In fact, over a trillion dollars, yes, that’s a T, is traded daily across all types of government debt.\n\nMoney market funds hold short-term government debt directly, while an HYSA earns its yield by banks using deposits to generate income, which they share with you. Currently, short-term interest rates are around 3.5%. Before you get too excited, that rate is annualized, not paid out every single month, although I really wish that were the case.\n\nStarting with the account most similar to a traditional savings account is a high-yield savings account. Two that I’ve used are the Apple Savings account and the Discover Online Savings account, since I hold both of their credit cards. The Apple Savings account is administered by Goldman Sachs. It currently pays 3.65% annual interest, though you must be an Apple Card holder to open it. There is no monthly maintenance fee or minimum deposit. You can deposit funds from a linked bank account, such as that PNC savings account that pays very little interest. Transfers to external bank accounts typically take one to three days.\n\nWhile there are no strict transfer limits, that delay can matter in an emergency. It is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000, meaning that if Goldman Sachs were to fail, the government would step in to protect your savings. One of the best perks is that Apple Card Daily Cash is automatically deposited into your account and starts earning interest immediately.\n\nDiscover Online Savings account pays about 3.4% APY, slightly below Apple’s. It also has no minimum deposit, no monthly maintenance fee, and is FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Both of these accounts represent the bare minimum a high-yield savings account should meet for an emergency fund.\n\nMy top choice, though, is the Fidelity Cash Management Account, or CMA. Your cash is automatically held in the SPAXX money market mutual fund, which invests in short-term government-issued debt. It is considered highly safe and currently pays around 3.6%. There are no monthly fees or minimum deposits, and the account comes with a debit card that reimburses ATM fees.\n\nLet’s say you diligently saved babysitting or lawn-mowing money all summer and managed to scrape together $15,000 for an emergency fund. Held in the PNC savings account paying 0.01%, over two years, you would earn about $3 in interest, enough for maybe a single Taco Bell burrito — congrats!\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r1gL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c32aff9-335a-47af-a5bc-e8b4ea0d78ab_912x564.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r1gL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c32aff9-335a-47af-a5bc-e8b4ea0d78ab_912x564.png)\n\n{{caption:Cash is still king but only if it is working}}\n\nIn a high-yield savings account or money market fund paying 3.5%, you would earn just over $1,050 in the same period. That’s nearly $50 per month of extra cash you can spend or reinvest. Speaking of reinvesting, let’s look at a longer-term example that shows how powerful efficient cash management can be.\n\nThis system only works if you pay your card in full every month and don’t spend more to chase rewards. I personally use the Fidelity Signature Visa card with 2% cashback. Assuming I spend $1,000 per month on the card, over ten years, I would earn $2,400 in cashback. If that cashback is deposited into my Fidelity Cash Management Account and earns 3.5% interest, it generates roughly another $500 in interest.\n\nFidelity automatically deposits cashback into the CMA. If we also assume a starting balance of $2,000 as a basic emergency fund, after ten years the account would grow to just over $5,700. That’s from cashback and interest alone, compared to essentially nothing if you were paying with a debit card and keeping your savings in a 0.01% account.\n\nRates fluctuate over time, but the principle stays the same: cash that earns something beats cash that does nothing.\n\nIt is absolutely critical to know where your cash is being held and who is benefiting from your savings. If your money sits in a conventional savings account, chances are you’re padding the bank’s bottom line far more than your own.\n\n***\n\n*Enjoyed this article?
