Read the first part of The Core Curriculum, *From Coffee Money to $1.5 Million* [here](https://crawfordanderson.substack.com/p/the-25-500-plan-from-coffee-money?r=3eob4x).\n\n***\n\nWe’ve all heard it. Samuel L. Jackson or Jennifer Garner asking, _“What’s in your wallet?”_ on TV or YouTube. It’s a catchy Capital One slogan, but I take it seriously because choosing the right cards literally puts money back in my pocket.\n\nLast week, in _[From Enticing Entrées to the Secret Sauce](https://open.substack.com/pub/crawfordanderson/p/from-enticing-entrees-to-the-secret?r=3eob4x\\&utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web\\&showWelcomeOnShare=true)_, we broke down how the eighth wonder of the world — compounding —fuels the exponential growth that builds your wealth over time. This week, we shift gears from the sauce station to the icing on the cake, exploring how to save a few extra bucks that, thanks to compounding, can multiply hundreds of times over the long run.\n\nWelcome to the world of cashback rewards!\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!628M!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fbf4a7a-1486-49c1-8a5e-33f1eb43a6f8_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!628M!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fbf4a7a-1486-49c1-8a5e-33f1eb43a6f8_1024x1024.png)\n\nThe number of cards I have may seem like overkill, but once you understand how this system works, you realize just how much money is on the table.\n\nEvery swipe of a card kicks off a chain of events. Merchants pay a fee, typically 2 to 3 percent, to accept credit cards and, to a lesser extent, debit cards. The card network (like Visa or Discover), the issuing bank, and a few back-end processors split that fee.\n\nWith Discover, it’s even simpler. They issue the card, lending me money directly, and run the network, so they keep more fees. Then they hand me 1% cash back for using it, along with 5% on a rotating quarterly category.\n\nIt adds up. A few weeks ago at Lydia’s Coffeehouse in New Hampshire (great Americano by the way!), I saw a sign that said they spend over $700 a month on credit card fees. And still, no surcharge, no minimum.\n\nThat’s how ubiquitous cards have become. A recent _Wall Street_ _[Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/walmart-amazon-stablecoin-07de2fdd?gaa_at=eafs\\&gaa_n=AWEtsqc83GDqgkl0GJQUqGcfQXjYMDimiNVOnwHrngJbV08tnZe8G__nAWwY4nGMYoo%3D\\&gaa_ts=68f043ac\\&gaa_sig=FrznnV3kSegw7LXbcTqxmLQEUfQ3XII-iBWFxC2tKE5TLKEj3WCq4zMgrYAUsDyqPh4KLnMkOAOJG29504iT-w%3D%3D)_ article noted that major corporations, such as Walmart and Amazon, are developing their own cryptocurrencies to bypass the billions in fees they pay each year. Small shops, especially, can’t afford to go cash-only, and they certainly don’t have the resources to launch their own cryptocurrency.\n\nFor now, businesses and consumers are stuck between the high fees of credit card networks and the lack of competitive payment alternatives, forced to play by the card companies’ rules and hoping to come out ahead.\n\nIt’s a messy and convoluted system, but as consumers, we can use it to our advantage. Understanding the interworkings of the credit card game is just the first step. In the following articles,\\[1] I will break down the cards I use, explain why I chose them, and show you how to build a wallet that earns rewards, builds credit, and never incurs interest, all with minimal effort. No one needs to spend hours a week optimizing for travel points or triple blah blah blah.\n\nCapital One asks, “What’s in your wallet?”\n\nHere’s a better question.\n\n**Do you know why it’s there?**\n\n_Because if you don’t, someone else definitely does, and they’re making money off your confusion._\n\n_You’ve learned how to earn from every swipe. Next week, we’ll cover the specifics of what’s in my wallet._\n\n***\n\n\\[1] Feels like déjà vu? You’re not crazy!
