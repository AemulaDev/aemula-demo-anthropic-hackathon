  "body": "Buffy began to awaken, snug and warm under a heavy blanket in her Fairlington Villages condo on a chilly fall morning as the sun peered through the wooden blinds in their small bedroom. She could detect the faint but steady hum of traffic of nearby I-395, known by long-time northern Virginians as Shirley Highway, the region’s main thoroughfare that was usually clogged by commuters during the morning and late afternoon hours.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8soh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd42f16e1-03fd-4458-966b-5ed22a665498_640x480.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8soh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd42f16e1-03fd-4458-966b-5ed22a665498_640x480.jpeg)\n\nShe could hear the rustling of her neighbors on the floor beneath her condo.\n\nFairlington Villages, straddling south Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia, is the nation’s oldest planned community, originally and hurriedly built with little to no insulation by the federal government during World War II to accommodate military officers and their families arriving at the Pentagon for training to fight Nazis. Today, it is a colonial-style condominium and townhouse community popular with federal employees. The former site of a former Civil War fort and defensive battery, it’s now on the registry of Historic Places. Nearby Shirlington Mall was the nation’s first “strip mall,” and is now a rebuilt and thriving commercial and business center.\n\nHer eyes open now, Buffy heard the faint thumping of a military helicopter over I-395 on its approach to the Pentagon, an almost hourly occurrence before the government shutdown quieted the skies over the busy highway. Hueys, Commanches, and other military helicopters use the highway for approach and departure to and from the Pentagon, which was just five miles away.\n\nIt was time to get up.\n\n[![A helicopter flies over a road race along the highway outside the Pentagon.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!77Lp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860343e4-8f11-4a6e-8fd3-794d34484ae2_500x312.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!77Lp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860343e4-8f11-4a6e-8fd3-794d34484ae2_500x312.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:Photo courtesy of Stripes.com}}\n\nBuffy, who just turned 50, thought about checking the weather on her Apple watch, since she liked to take, thanks to the government shutdown, late-morning electric bike rides on the nearby Four Mile Run, Mount Vernon and W\\&OD trails, but thought today would be a nice day just to enjoy their well-manicured historic community, maybe take in a walk or drive out to Loudoun County wine country later in the afternoon. Many wineries were offering [free glasses to furloughed federal employees](https://northernvirginiamag.com/news/2025/10/01/find-deals-and-giveaways-for-furloughed-workers-in-northern-virginia-and-dc/), not to mention discounted or free food.\n\nShe began relying on the morning sun to awaken her 40 days ago, when the government shutdown began and she was immediately furloughed, without pay, as a GS-15 career deputy director making over [$195,000 annually](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2025/DCB.pdf) at the General Services Administration’s Public Building Service, responsible for managing [7,700 vacant federally owned properties](https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ernst-fast-tracks-sale-of-vacant-federal-buildings-costing-taxpayers-billions) across the country, with a budget exceeding $81 million.\n\nBiff, almost 55, her husband of nearly 25 years, was already up and quietly making their morning gourmet coffee in their imported French press, just the way they liked it. Buffy’s eyebrows were raised as the aroma of the organic, fair-trade [Kenyan](https://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-origins/kenya/) dark blend wafted past her nostrils. She was awake now.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ev11!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F448037cd-3eba-4cb1-8305-8399a0fc08b3_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ev11!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F448037cd-3eba-4cb1-8305-8399a0fc08b3_1024x1024.png)\n\n{{caption:Biff, our fictional federal employee. Image produced by Google Gemini}}\n\nAs she struggled to sit up in bed, Biff emerged at the bedroom door, not with a cup of coffee for her, but staring intently at his new iPhone 17. “Oh my god,” he exclaimed.\n\n“What?” Buffy groggily asked as she struggled to sit up in their bed. “Where’s my coffee?”\n\n“More Senate Democrats caved. The shutdown is almost over. We’re going to have to go back to work.”\n\n“ACK!” Buffy almost shrieked. “What happened?”\n\n“Five more Democrats in the Senate caved. _Including Tim,_” Biff said, referring to Virginia’s junior US Senator, former Governor, and 2016 Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, Tim Kaine, a long-standing champion of federal workers.\n\n“TIM?” Buffy angrily exclaimed, fully awake now, turning and fumbling for her slippers at her bedside. “Oh my god. Well, did they get something for giving in to Trump and those f-ing Republicans? How much did we contribute to Kaine’s reelection last year, along with knocking on a couple of hundred doors for him here in Fairlington? Our neighborhood went more than three-to-one for Kaine over that horrible Republican, Hung Cao. I can’t believe he’s the Undersectary of the Navy.”\n\n[![Hung Cao and Donald Trump](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H4W_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff031ab57-75eb-437d-9da2-7654565673df_500x281.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H4W_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff031ab57-75eb-437d-9da2-7654565673df_500x281.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:President Trump with Undersecretary of the Navy and 2024 Virginia Republican Senate nominee and Vietnam refugee, retired Navy Captain Hung Cao.}}\n\n“Umm, lemme see,” said Biff, scrolling through his phone as Buffy darted past him on the way to the kitchen for coffee. “Oh, they got 4,000 fired federal workers reinstated and restored funding for a program I work on, the [McGovern-Dole Food for Education and Child Nutrition program](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-XV/part-1599), so that’s GREAT!” added Biff, a career GS-14 administrator at the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service in charge of grant-making, [making over $166,000 annually](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2025/DCB.pdf).\n\n“Looks like my job is saved, and they kept a regulation that will allow us to [keep getting our marijuana and hemp gummies,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/11/inside-shutdown-deal-cannabis-charlie-kirk-jack-smith/87214014007/)” Biff added. “The compromise included the USDA’s annual appropriations, so I’m set. I got so tired of answering questions from those Trump MAGAts at OMB, who tried to kill my program. It’s bad enough that Secretary Rollins wants to close our USDA building and send me. . .send us . . . _somewhere_. I have nightmares about them transferring us to. . .” Biff swallowed hard and shuddered as he looked up alarmingly from his phone, “. . . _Oklahoma_. My god, we could wind up in _West Virginia!_”\n\nBuffy glared at Biff. “I’d rather _die_.”\n\n“OMG,” Biff mused, “what would we do with our Kennedy Center and Arena Stage season tickets?”\n\n“But what about _Obamacare?_” Buffy asked. “That’s what this whole shutdown was about, extending Obamacare subsidies for people like our neighbors, the Grants next door.” Bill and Betty Grant\\* were each self-employed federal contractors who worked remotely from their two-bedroom-with-a-loft condominium next door on the top level of their three-story walk up. Neither couple had any children.\n\n“Maybe [Tim’s long COVID](https://time.com/6172625/tim-kaine-long-covid/) got to him,” Biff mused. “Damn those Trump vaccines. That reminds me; I’m due for my eighth booster shot.”\n\nThe Grants, one an economist and the other a federal IT project manager making close to $500,000 combined annually, complained about losing their $8,000 Obamacare subsidy on their health insurance, which began in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their monthly premiums were scheduled to almost double on January 1.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9846!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b009496-e416-414c-b6d5-def14d8bc80e_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9846!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b009496-e416-414c-b6d5-def14d8bc80e_1024x1024.png)\n\n{{caption:Biff and Buffy’s fictional neighbor, Betty, a federal IT contractor who works remotely. Photo by Google Gemini.}}\n\n“Umm, a vote on extending the subsidies was promised for sometime in December,” Biff mumbled as he scrolled through his phone. “Boy, the Grants are not going to like this.”\n\n“NEITHER DO I,” exclaimed Buffy, vigorously tossing her purple-died hair into something resembling order as she angrily opened the refrigerator to find her favorite organic yogurt and granola from the famous “Red Truck” bakery in quaint Marshall, Virginia, an hour west of Washington (on a good day). “This is a bad day for _democracy_.” She slammed the refrigerator door, grabbed a spoon from the drawer, and sat down at their kitchen table as another helicopter flew by. “I guess the shutdown really is over.”\n\nBiff turned and sat across from Buffy at their kitchen table, reaching for his hot java. “Frankly, it will be nice to get paychecks again, and the back pay will cover our next European vacation. But I’ll miss sleeping in.”\n\n“This wasn’t ABOUT US,” Buffy fumed at Biff. “This was about _saving health care_. This is the sacrifice we make for defeating Trump and the MAGAts! _No kings!_” Buffy almost screamed. “I’m so mad at Tim that I could just _scream_! This is no compromise, it’s _surrender!_ I’m going to call Don (Congressman Don Beyer, R-VA) this morning and tell him to vote no! If he votes yes, I’m returning the new Volvo XC90 that I bought from his dealership!”\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yeeT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa005133c-bdbc-4980-8158-da6f6b0a7d64_983x374.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yeeT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa005133c-bdbc-4980-8158-da6f6b0a7d64_983x374.webp)\n\nBiff calmly sipped on his coffee, reached for his phone again, and read further into the news coverage of the Senate’s vote to invoke cloture on Sunday, ending debate and setting up a final 60-40 vote Monday before the amended legislation went to the US House, and then the President for enactment. “I think [Beyer is already a hard no](https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=8687). The shutdown looks to end Wednesday night,” Biff added, “unless somehow there are the votes to defeat it in the House. _It doesn’t look like it_. I think we’re back to work Thursday. Reminds me, I’ve got to get to Shirlington Cleaners this afternoon for my dry cleaning.”\n\n_KNOCK KNOCK._\n\nBiff and Buffy were startled to hear two faint knocks at their door.\n\n“It’s Betty,” Buffy said, as she raised up from her kitchen chair. “I recognize that knock. I don’t care if she sees us like this, they’re good friends.”\n\nShe walked over to open the door, horrified by the pained and frightened look on the face of her next door neighbor, Betty, her arms folded as if she hit in the stomach.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1iO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c3f54fc-3634-470e-b532-9a6a4560c055_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e1iO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c3f54fc-3634-470e-b532-9a6a4560c055_1024x1024.png)\n\n{{caption:Our fictional Buffy greets a worried Betty at their door. Photo by Google Gemini.}}\n\n“My god, Betty, you look terrible. Please come in. Biff made coffee,” Buffy said, opening the door and motioning her to their small kitchen table. Their condos were identical but mirror opposites of each other. They’d been neighbors for more than two decades.\n\n“_We’re going to lose our condo in Vail_,” Betty said, almost sobbing. “Or maybe the one at Steamboat Springs. We can’t afford the increase in Obamacare and keep up on our real estate investments. We’ll have to sell something. _I’m so upset!_” Betty dropped her head and began to sob.\n\n“And my lakeside house in Grand Lake! _Where will I spend my summers?_”\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4_J2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96d1873a-6b5d-4748-b0f4-10cf4cb2a9d1_1920x1080.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4_J2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96d1873a-6b5d-4748-b0f4-10cf4cb2a9d1_1920x1080.webp)\n\n{{caption:Grand Lake, Colorado}}\n\n“That’s _terrible_,” Biff said, sipping on his coffee. “We’ve really enjoyed our winter vacations in Vail. You’ve been kind to make your condo available to us. And your wine collection in Grand Lake is to _die for_.”\n\n“Well, at least I was able to work full time for the Jay Jones campaign while the government was shutdown,” Betty said. “Me, too!” exclaimed Buffy. They both referred to the new Attorney General-elect of Virginia, who won despite texts fantasizing about the murder of a Republican political opponent and his children. “Those stupid text messages didn’t really hurt. A lot of Democrats I talked to gave him a thumbs up,” Betty said.\n\n“I guess the shutdown had its benefits,” Biff said. “We got a nice 41-day unpaid vacation out of it, and now _we’re going to get back pay_ for our “volunteer work” for the Virginia Democratic campaigns. But don’t you worry about that Vail condo,” Biff said, reaching over to hold and pat Betty’s hand. “I think there are enough Republicans who will cut a deal on extending those subsidies, at least for awhile.”\n\n“Gosh, _I hope so_,” Betty said, breathing a sigh of relief. “I would have to have to choose between one of my Colorado properties and my [Virginia car tax](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/07/21/earle-sears-and-spanberger-both-say-they-want-to-eliminate-the-car-tax-heres-why-that-is-unlikely-to-happen/). _I can’t afford both_.

Warner’s voting way more _our way_ than he used to. Tim said he was too focused on the Virginia elections to understand the Schumer strategy on the shutdown. His explanation really _didn’t make any sense_ to me. Kaine said [he didn’t really know why he was voting against keeping the government open](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/11/10/tim-kaine-focused-on-elections-not-shutdown-n2666204).”\n\n“_I could have told him,_” Buffy said, angrily. “We’ve _got_ to move to a ‘Medicare for All’ system and this was one more step in the right direction. And we must defeat Trump _at all costs!_”\n\n“So long as they don’t mess with the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program,” Biff chimed in. “It really works for us, and now that we’re nearing 25 years of federal service, we get to keep it after we retire. Medicare’s going bankrupt, and _I want nothing to do with it_. And I sure don’t want to go on Obamacare until I’m 65.”\n\nBuffy and Betty _glared_ at Biff.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4aj3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf07e9c5-9402-4f8e-93b8-e003db0ff57b_1052x615.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4aj3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf07e9c5-9402-4f8e-93b8-e003db0ff57b_1052x615.webp)\n\n{{caption:A real photo of US Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)}}\n\n“Having said all that, it looks like Trump won this round,” Biff said. “But look at the bright side. We _won_ Virginia. We’re going to get new congressional seats that will eliminate three _evil Republicans_ from our state’s congressional delegation. And if we get control of the Congress next year, we will have successfully defended _our way of life,_” Biff said.\n\n“We’re doing our part in Northern Virginia!” Betty exclaimed. Do you know that the five counties of Northern Virginia provided 88 percent of the new Governor’s (Abigail Spanberger’s) margin of victory? _And all of Jay Jones’s!_ Federal workers know what’s best for Virginia.”\n\n“Like our new mayor of New York said in his victory speech - did you hear what he _said?_” Buffy exclaimed. “It was so _wonderful_ that I memorized it:\n\n> **‘We will prove that there is no problem too large for government to solve, and no concern too small for it to care about.’**\n\n_“Heart, be still!_”\n\n[![Zohran Mamdani delivers victory speech on Election night with his banner behind him.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!L4_x!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8289d79f-d7ed-4eb6-97e7-e979987645d1_1200x675.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!L4_x!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8289d79f-d7ed-4eb6-97e7-e979987645d1_1200x675.jpeg)\n\n{{caption:New York Mayor Elect Zohran Mamdani on election night.}}\n\n“_That’s what our public service is all about,_” Buffy said, finally calming down after Biff woke her with the news. “Our way of life, indeed. With enough money, _there’s no problem too big for government to solve_. We know what best for America.”\n\nBiff, Buffy, and Betty all smiled at each other.\n\n“Oh, wait, I almost forgot,” Buffy said as she rose and turned around to pick up a small package from the kitchen counter. “I remembered your purple hair dye from [Lorena Bobbitt](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-02-10-mn-30396-story.html) down at the Shirlington salon. I use it, too. Looks great, don’t you think?” Biff almost dropped his near-empty coffee cup.\n\nBuffy and Betty smiled. “Thank for cheering me up and calming me down,” Betty said. “Now, we’ve got to make sure Tim (Kaine) gets Bill and I the Obamacare subsidy we need. Maybe I should offer Tim some time at my Vail condo?”\n\n\\* _**None of the primary characters here are real, and neither is this story. Any resemblance to real people is purely coincidental.
