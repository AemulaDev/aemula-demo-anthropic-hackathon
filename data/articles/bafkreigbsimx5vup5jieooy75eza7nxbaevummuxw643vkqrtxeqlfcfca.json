Convicted perpetrators like Vincenzo Vinciguerra – a neo-fascist who carried out the 1972 Peteano car bombing – later revealed that these attacks were **intended to terrorize the public and justify authoritarian crackdowns on the left** [phpisn.ethz.ch](https://phpisn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/synopsis76c1.html?navinfo=15301#:~:text=called%20%E2%80%9Cstrategy%20of%20tension%E2%80%9D%20through,or%20collaboration%E2%80%9D%2C%20Vincenzo%20Vinciguerra%20testified) [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=3%20As%20one%20of%20the,the%20end%20of%20World%20War). _“The secret armies supplied right-wing terrorists with explosives... attacks on the Italian population were thereafter blamed on the communist party and the left in general in order to discredit the political opponent,”_ Vinciguerra testified [phpisn.ethz.ch](https://phpisn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/synopsis76c1.html?navinfo=15301#:~:text=called%20%E2%80%9Cstrategy%20of%20tension%E2%80%9D%20through,or%20collaboration%E2%80%9D%2C%20Vincenzo%20Vinciguerra%20testified). According to Italy’s parliamentary inquiries, **military secret services not only knew of these crimes but helped coordinate them**, effectively creating a _“clandestine parallel”_ apparatus that subverted democracy [en.wikisource.org](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/European_Parliament_resolution_on_Gladio#:~:text=D,evidenced%20by%2C%20various%20judicial%20inquiries).\n\nI interview the Swiss historian Dr. Daniele Ganser who investigated these terror networks that wreaked havoc in whole Europe.\n\n{{youtube:DoTUFeKZB5A}}\n\n**Italy’s “Years of Lead” (late 1960s–1980s)** saw a string of deadly bombings initially pinned on far-left radicals, only for investigations years later to uncover **far-right and state involvement**. For example:\n\n* _Piazza Fontana bombing (Milan, 1969):_ 17 killed in a bank blast first blamed on anarchists – one anarchist suspect died in police custody – but later evidence pointed to neo-fascist perpetrators, part of a campaign to induce panic and anti-left sentiment [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=,also%20been%20members%20of%20a).\n\n* _Peteano bombing (1972):_ A booby-trapped car killed 3 police officers; authorities at first accused Red Brigades (left-wing militants). The truth, unearthed by Judge Felice Casson in 1984, was that **neo-fascist Vinciguerra planted the bomb with support from the stay-behind network.** The explosives came from hidden Gladio arms caches, tying Italy’s military intelligence directly to the crime [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/11/14/cia-organized-secret-army-in-western-europe/e0305101-97b9-4494-bc18-d89f42497d85/#:~:text=terrorist%20attack%20that%20took%20place,18%20years%20ago) [phpisn.ethz.ch](https://phpisn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/synopsis76c1.html?navinfo=15301#:~:text=having%20carried%20out%20the%20Peteano,or%20collaboration%E2%80%9D%2C%20Vincenzo%20Vinciguerra%20testified).\n\n* _Bologna train station massacre (1980):_ A massive bomb killed 85 people – the worst terrorist atrocity in postwar Italy. **Courts ultimately convicted members of the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR), a neo-fascist group, for the attack**, sentencing leaders Valerio Fioravanti and Francesca Mambro to life in prison [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/07/italian-official-rebuked-for-proclaiming-innocence-of-bologna-terrorists#:~:text=Five%20members%20of%20the%20now,do%20with%20the%20Bologna%20massacre%E2%80%9D). Decades of trials confirmed that **several other neo-fascists and even P2 Masonic lodge figures colluded in the Bologna bombing**, financing and guiding the attackers while planting disinformation to mislead investigators [atlasofwars.com](https://www.atlasofwars.com/the-bologna-massacre-the-right-wing-government-between-silence-and-denial/#:~:text=The%20involvement%20of%20some%20Italian,deflect%20the%20judicial%20investigations%2C%20but) [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=,act%20of%20terrorism%2C%20two%20secret). In fact, two Italian intelligence agents were convicted for attempting to derail the Bologna investigation – a clear indication of **security services’ complicity** in the cover-up. _(Notably, Italy’s intelligence chief at the time, Pietro Musumeci, and a P2-affiliated colonel were found guilty of fabricating evidence to blame foreign terrorists)_ [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=,act%20of%20terrorism%2C%20two%20secret).\n\nItalian officials eventually admitted the existence of Operation Gladio, the codename for the stay-behind network, in 1990. An EU Parliament resolution that year **condemned these clandestine “manipulative and operational networks” and noted that in certain states,** \\_**“military secret services… were involved in serious cases of terrorism and crime,”**\\_urging full investigations [en.wikisource.org](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/European_Parliament_resolution_on_Gladio#:~:text=D,evidenced%20by%2C%20various%20judicial%20inquiries). As Europe learned, **Italy was not alone**.\n\n**Belgium** in the early 1980s faced its own “strategy of tension.” A mysterious cell dubbed the **“Brabant killers”** carried out random massacres at supermarkets (1982–85), killing 28 people, alongside a far-left militant cell bombing property – a dual campaign of fear. For years the perpetrators were unidentified, fueling theories of **“opposed extremes” working in tandem** to destabilize the country. Subsequent inquiries unearthed that the so-called random “mad killers” in fact had **ties to neo-Nazi groups**, and moreover, that **agents of Belgian state security had connections with both the far-right killers and the left-wing cell**. In other words, **elements of the security apparatus were secretly abetting or provoking the very terrorism publicly blamed on “extremists.”** Belgian lawmakers concluded that these attacks were **“political destabilization” modeled on the Italian strategy of tension** – a campaign to create chaos and fear that would justify harder-line state measures. (Indeed, Belgium’s parliament found it _“widely suggested that the apparently opposed political extremes were actually allied in a common cause,”_ with evidence that state agents were involved behind the scenes [ojp.gov](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/strategy-tension-belgian-terrorist-crisis-1982-1986#:~:text=Both%20groups%20were%20apparently%20seeking,30%20notes%20%28Author%20abstract).)\n\nBy the end of the Cold War, the pattern was undeniable: **secret NATO-backed networks had empowered far-right terrorists to carry out false-flag attacks**. The **intended effect was to terrorize the public and blame the left**, thereby _“encouraging support for a corrupt status quo,”_ even **nudging governments toward authoritarian rule**. As one Italian conspirator put it, the December 1969 bombing (Piazza Fontana) was meant as _“the detonator which would convince the authorities to declare a state of emergency”_ and crush the communist opposition. This cynical calculus – **using fear as a weapon to alter political reality** – lies at the heart of the strategy of tension [phpisn.ethz.ch](https://phpisn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/synopsis76c1.html?navinfo=15301#:~:text=called%20%E2%80%9Cstrategy%20of%20tension%E2%80%9D%20through,or%20collaboration%E2%80%9D%2C%20Vincenzo%20Vinciguerra%20testified) [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=,also%20been%20members%20of%20a).\n\n**Contested Assassinations and Attribution Inversion: The Olof Palme Case**\n\nHigh-profile political assassinations during this era also bred **“attribution inversion”** – immediate blame cast in one direction while evidence pointed elsewhere. A prime example is **Sweden’s unsolved 1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme**, a crime around which competing narratives have swirled for decades. Palme, a Social Democratic leader and outspoken international critic of apartheid and the Vietnam War, was gunned down on a Stockholm street at night with **no police protection**. In the vacuum of certainty, **authorities initially pursued convenient culprits rather than uncomfortable truths**.\n\nUnder intense pressure to find Palme’s killer, the first investigative team (led by Stockholm police chief Hans Holmér) fixated on the idea of a _foreign left-wing conspiracy_. Within months they launched a massive probe into the Kurdish separatist PKK, raiding and detaining Kurdish activists – **despite virtually no evidence**. This “Kurd track” ultimately imploded, yielding no charges; it’s now regarded as a grave misstep. Critics note that **Holmér seemed eager to pin the murder on a politically palatable villain (foreign extremists) rather than probe closer to home** [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/16/olof-palme-sweden-prime-minister-unsolved-murder-new-evidence#:~:text=Others%20believe%20the%20problem%20was,no%20one%20would%20have%20missed%E2%80%9D). Indeed, Holmér himself led an infamous unit of Swedish police known to harbor far-right sympathies, and speculation later arose that **Swedish security elements may have had their own role in Palme’s demise**. (At the time, Swedish society contained a virulent anti-Palme strain on the right – some military and police figures viewed Palme as a traitor, and reportedly \\*\\*“toasts \\[were] raised in celebration”\\*\\*in certain police circles when news of his death broke [wsws.org](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/06/13/palm-j13.html#:~:text=Palme%E2%80%99s%20assassination%20through%20a%20combination,when%20the%20news%20reached%20them).)\n\nAfter the Kurdish angle failed, authorities tried another simplistic solution: a lone local culprit. In 1988 they arrested Christer Pettersson, a drug-addicted petty criminal, and secured a quick conviction – **providing a scapegoat “whom no one would miss,” as one author put it**. But Pettersson’s conviction was overturned on appeal for lack of evidence. This revolving door of suspects fostered public cynicism that the **real architects – potentially far-right operatives or intelligence agencies – were being shielded**. As one Swedish investigator observed, _“the fundamental problem was that Holmér did not know what he was doing”_ – or worse, he avoided pursuing leads into right-wing and **inside-job possibilities that would “be ugly” for the state** [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/16/olof-palme-sweden-prime-minister-unsolved-murder-new-evidence#:~:text=Others%20believe%20the%20problem%20was,no%20one%20would%20have%20missed%E2%80%9D).\n\nOnly in 2020 did Sweden’s prosecutors abruptly declare the case “solved,” naming **Stig Engström** (a Swedish graphic designer present at the scene) as the likely shooter – but Engström had died 20 years prior, meaning no trial could test the evidence. This finale convinced few. **The chief prosecutor admitted that the case against Engström would not have stood up in court** (the evidence was _“too thin to secure a conviction”_). Swedish media called the conclusion _“a great anticlimax… a monument to a policing fiasco”_[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/doubts-remain-as-sweden-closes-case-of-palme-assassination-after-34-years-idUSKBN23H106/#:~:text=,monument%20to%20a%20policing%20fiasco). Many Swedes remain unconvinced that the _truth of who ultimately orchestrated Palme’s murder has seen daylight_. After 34 years, the long investigation closed with more questions than answers, **having touched on theories implicating everyone from far-right police elements to the CIA, South African apartheid agents, and Kurdish militants**. That gamut of accused parties – _“from the CIA and Kurdish separatists to the South African security services”_ – illustrates how **each narrator of the Palme saga chose an antagonist suiting their politics** **[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/doubts-remain-as-sweden-closes-case-of-palme-assassination-after-34-years-idUSKBN23H106/#:~:text=His%20support%20for%20the%20anti,critical%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union).** Meanwhile, critical leads suggesting **domestic right-wing or “stay-behind” involvement were never fully pursued**. A 2019 report noted that Palme had made powerful enemies among right-wing circles (domestically and abroad), and that **the original investigation’s incompetence gave rise to “the popular theory that Palme was murdered by right-wing extremists within the police force”** [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/16/olof-palme-sweden-prime-minister-unsolved-murder-new-evidence#:~:text=the%20murder%2C%20at%20least%20four,expressing%20support%20for%20Nazi%20ideology). Several of Holmér’s officers – nicknamed the “Baseball League” – openly sympathized with neo-Nazi ideas. Yet, as an investigative journalist observed, _“the likelihood that far-right domestic forces were involved was never seriously probed”_ – an omission many attribute to a cover-up impulse at the highest level s[wsws.org](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/06/13/palm-j13.html#:~:text=The%20way%20in%20which%20the,and%20beat%20up%20opponents%20in). In sum, the Palme case reveals a **recurring dynamic**: initial blame targeted leftist or foreign culprits, while substantial evidence of right-wing or _“para-state”_ complicity was ignored or downplayed to avoid destabilizing the establishment narrative. The result is a lingering sense that _truth was subordinate to political convenience_, and a political assassination officially remains “unsolved,” albeit conveniently closed.\n\n📌 Before we continue — if this piece gave you something to think about, please **restack it and share**.

For _years_ these racist killings were **not recognized as far-right terror at all**; instead, German authorities **insisted the murders must be gang or mafia violence within immigrant communities**. Police and media spoke of the “Döner Murders,” suggesting Turkish organized crime, and even interrogated victims’ families as suspects, while **ignoring clues pointing to neo-Nazi perpetrators** [aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2013/5/6/neo-nazi-murder-trial-begins-in-germany#:~:text=issue%2C%20ranging%20from%20official%20incompetence,for%20so%20long%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said). This **systemic bias – or willful blindness – meant the true killers were free to continue their spree for seven years**. It was only in late 2011, after two NSU members died in a botched robbery and evidence of their guilt surfaced, that Germany finally confronted the reality of a neo-Nazi terror network in its midst. Chancellor Angela Merkel later apologized for the _“disgrace”_ that authorities had _“failed to see the far-right motive”_ and instead stigmatized immigrant communities [independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-secret-service-destroys-files-on-neonazi-terrorist-gang-the-national-socialist-underground-7897090.html#:~:text=The%20killings%20were%20mostly%20carried,Nazis%20were%20involved).\n\nWorse, once the NSU cell was exposed, it emerged that **Germany’s domestic intelligence had numerous undercover informants around the neo-Nazi scene – and that officials shredded hundreds of relevant files right as the investigation got underway**. In an astonishing scandal, agents of the Verfassungsschutz (BfV) **destroyed documents on November 11, 2011 – the very day they were due to turn them over to prosecutors** [independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-secret-service-destroys-files-on-neonazi-terrorist-gang-the-national-socialist-underground-7897090.html#:~:text=They%20revealed%20to%20a%20parliamentary,had%20taken%20over%20the%20investigation). This prompted furious questions: **Were elements of the security services protecting the NSU or covering up their own negligence?** The incident “fueled suspicions that NSU members were on the secret service payroll,” essentially **“active collaboration”** by some intelligence personnel[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-secret-service-destroys-files-on-neonazi-terrorist-gang-the-national-socialist-underground-7897090.html#:~:text=to%20the%20inquiry%20that%20his,Nazi%20investigation). Indeed, parliamentary inquiries confirmed that multiple German agencies had paid informants within neo-Nazi circles frequented by the NSU trio[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-secret-service-destroys-files-on-neonazi-terrorist-gang-the-national-socialist-underground-7897090.html#:~:text=The%20revelations%20increased%20suspicions%20that,NSU%20ringleaders%20Mundlos%20and%20B%C3%B6hnhardt). The unavoidable impression was that the **state had infiltrated the far right** _**and then looked the other way**_ – or even abetted – as its agents’ associates carried out murders. _“The whole affair is intolerable and there must be consequences,”_ declared one appalled Bundestag member when learning of the file shredding [independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-secret-service-destroys-files-on-neonazi-terrorist-gang-the-national-socialist-underground-7897090.html#:~:text=frequented%20by%20NSU%20ringleaders%20Mundlos,and%20B%C3%B6hnhardt).\n\nGermany’s highest-profile neo-Nazi trial (of surviving NSU member Beate Zschäpe, in 2013–2018) did bring convictions, but it **left many questions unanswered**. Victims’ families remain convinced that _“giving a heavy sentence to only one member of the NSU is not fully bringing the most violent neo-Nazi network to justice”_ – implying **additional accomplices or enablers in the shadows** [humanrightsfirst.org](https://humanrightsfirst.org/library/the-germany-nsu-trial-justice-does-not-go-deep-part-5/#:~:text=The%20Germany%20NSU%20Trial%3A%20Justice,). Subsequent investigations documented an array of **“institutional failures”**: from **police agencies’ early refusal to acknowledge racist motives (labeling the killings** _**“Turkish mafia”**_**hits), to intelligence officials’ deliberate obstruction (withholding or destroying evidence).** A parliamentary review in 2013 blasted the authorities’ blindness to right-wing terror as a case of _“institutional racism”_ and incompetence [aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2013/5/6/neo-nazi-murder-trial-begins-in-germany#:~:text=issue%2C%20ranging%20from%20official%20incompetence,for%20so%20long%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said). In effect, the NSU saga showed how **deeply a narrative can diverge from reality when bias and cover-up take hold**: for the better part of a decade, the German public was told to fear immigrant crime gangs, while the actual killers – neo-fascists – operated unchecked and even indirectly paid by the state.\n\n**The Charlie Kirk Assassination: Instant Blame in the Digital Age**\n\nFast-forward to the present: the September 2025 assassination of **Charlie Kirk**, a prominent right-wing American commentator, starkly demonstrated how **rapid narrative weaponization has become in the social media era**. Kirk was fatally shot on a university stage in Utah during a speaking event – an act of political violence that immediately ignited an online maelstrom. _Within minutes_ of the shooting, **partisan influencers and anonymous accounts began assigning blame – overwhelmingly pointing to “the Left” or anti-fascist activists as the culprits, absent any evidence**. This **“time-to-blame” window has virtually collapsed to zero**: initial facts were scarce, but a “flood of false and misleading claims” filled social platforms **within minutes**, as people raced to fit the tragedy into pre-existing political frames [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=The%20reaction%20followed%20a%20well,erroneously%20reporting%20on%20Robinson%E2%80%99s%20background).\n\nCrucially, **no suspect had been identified by authorities on Day 1** – the gunman escaped the scene – yet that didn’t stop online figures (and even some officials) from confidently pinning Kirk’s murder on ideological opponents. **Rumors and misinformation proliferated**: misidentified photos of random individuals were circulated as the “shooter”; one image of a man in a Democratic Socialists t-shirt went viral with claims the killer was a DSA member – a claim quickly proven false. In reality, police had not named any suspect at that point. Nonetheless, _“many on social media were quick to assume the shooter was a Democrat,”_ and \\*_prominent conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, openly_ _**“blamed liberal politics” for Kirk’s death almost immediately**_ [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=THE%20FACTS%3A%20This%20is%20false,liberal%20politics%20for%20Kirk%E2%80%99s%20death). This **instant attribution** – effectively a reflex to blame “the Left” – came **well before any facts emerged** about the perpetrator. Utah’s Republican governor did label the act a _“political assassination”_ and urged calm, but on the ground, a narrative stampede was underway [aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/11/when-and-where-charlie-kirk-was-shot-a-visual-timeline#:~:text=Advertisement). Right-wing media ecosystems lit up with accusations that Kirk was targeted by _“Antifa,” “the radical left,”_ or even government agents, while on the extreme fringes, conversely, some spread **bizarre counter-conspiracies blaming Mossad or “deep state” actors** for a false flag (showing that such disinformation is not confined to one side) [splcenter.org](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/charlie-kirk-antisemitic-conspiracy-theories/#:~:text=Antisemitic%20conspiracy%20theories%20claim%20Israel%2C,payback%20for%20challenging%20supposed%20Jewish).\n\nIt took **two days** for law enforcement to apprehend a suspect – a 22-year-old Utah man named Tyler Robinson – and **publicly debunk several of the swirling false claims** [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=A%20flood%20of%20false%20and,Kirk%20at%20Utah%20Valley%20University). Robinson, it turned out, had no clear party affiliation (registered as an unaffiliated voter) and no known ties to any leftist organization. According to Utah’s governor, the suspect’s family said he had become “more political” recently and had criticized Kirk’s views – ammunition found with him bore **“taunting, anti-fascist… meme-culture messaging”** – suggesting the shooter may have been motivated by anger at Kirk’s far-right politics. If so, this would indeed frame the assassination as **ideologically driven from the left** (the very scenario many presumed). However, the crucial point is that **the narrative was locked in long before any of these nuances were confirmed**. Once a partisan storyline (“leftist militant kills conservative leader”) was established in the immediate aftermath, it spread faster than any later correction. By the time facts caught up – e.g. confirming the suspect’s identity and mental state – millions had already consumed and internalized the initial narrative. In today’s hyper-polarized media environment, **the** _**perception**_ **of what happened can harden within hours**, and corrections rarely catch up with the first impression. As the Associated Press noted in its fact-check, _“the reaction followed a well-worn pattern of misinformation and conspiracy theories… when facts can be fluid”_[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=The%20reaction%20followed%20a%20well,erroneously%20reporting%20on%20Robinson%E2%80%99s%20background). The Kirk case exemplified that pattern: **an information void filled by partisan assumptions**, then only belatedly corrected by actual investigation.\n\n_**Timeline of the Narrative (Kirk Assassination, 2025):**_\n\n* **T0 – The Attack (Sept 10, mid-day):** Kirk is shot once by a sniper at a Utah Valley University event and later dies of his wound [aljazeera.com](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/11/when-and-where-charlie-kirk-was-shot-a-visual-timeline#:~:text=Right%20then%2C%20a%20single%20shot,is%20heard) [abcnews.go.com](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-vance-lawmakers-react-shooting-charlie-kirk/story?id=125452435#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%20announced%20conservative,university%20campus%20event%20in%20Utah).

Hashtags blaming Democrats trend on X (Twitter). Meanwhile, law enforcement only confirms that an unknown shooter is at large.\n\n* **T+1 day (Sept 11):** No arrest yet. Online, misinformation snowballs: one **viral claim falsely identifies a 77-year-old Canadian man as the shooter**, after that innocent man’s image was mis-shared from the scene [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=CLAIM%3A%20The%20shooter%20was%20identified,Michael%20Mallinson%20or%20George%20Zinn). Another rumor alleges the gunman was a DSA (Democratic Socialists of America) member, citing a photo of someone else in a DSA shirt – which DSA quickly refutes (_“no member by that name”_) [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=CLAIM%3A%20Robinson%20is%20a%20member,the%20Democratic%20Socialists%20of%20America). **These narratives reinforce the “leftist assassin” theme** and are amplified in certain media before being debunked. On Capitol Hill, the atmosphere is tense: the House holds a moment of silence for Kirk, during which a procedural scuffle breaks out (some Republicans accuse Democrats of not sufficiently supporting a prayer for Kirk), further politicizing the tragedy.\n\n* **T+2 days (Sept 12):** Police announce the arrest of suspect Tyler Robinson, providing actual details. They dispel prior misidentifications and confirm Robinson was not affiliated with any political group. They also clarify that initial _other people detained (like a man named George Zinn who was briefly handcuffed on campus)_ were **unrelated**, quashing conspiracies about multiple shooters or an inside job [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=CLAIM%3A%20The%20shooter%20was%20identified,Michael%20Mallinson%20or%20George%20Zinn). This is when **factual clarity finally enters the public record – but by now the entrenched narrative in some quarters (“leftist terrorist kills Kirk”) is difficult to undo**.\n\nIn sum, the Charlie Kirk assassination showed how **decades-old tactics of blame inversion now play out at light speed**. Whereas during the Cold War it took months or years for false narratives to unravel, today **false narratives form in real time**. The same underlying principle holds: **violence is exploited to paint the opponent (in this case, “the Left”) as an existential threat**, whether or not that bears out in evidence. The difference is the **amplification machinery** – social media echo chambers, partisan news – which can cement a misleading storyline long before investigators or journalists establish the facts. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: **perceptions drive immediate political reactions, which in turn pressure authorities to “confirm” a convenient story**, sometimes at the expense of truth. It’s the _strategy of tension on broadband_: fear and anger are stoked instantly, and the public “memory” of the event becomes hardwired to the initial spin.\n\n**Policy Ratchet: From Fear Narrative to NSPM-7**\n\nPerhaps the most consequential aspect of these tactics is how they are used to **justify shifts in policy and expansions of state power**. Framing a violent incident as the work of a nefarious political sector paves the way for authorities to _“do something”_ – often to crack down on that very sector. We saw this in Cold War Europe (where fear of “left-wing terror” aided the passage of emergency laws and repression of dissidents [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=,also%20been%20members%20of%20a)). We see it again in the United States today: **the rapid blaming of “the Left” after Kirk’s assassination fed directly into calls for sweeping domestic security measures**, epitomized by the rollout of **NSPM-7**.\n\n**NSPM-7 (National Security Presidential Memorandum 7)**, signed by President Trump in late September 2025, is a directive on _“Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence.”_ In effect, it **uses recent incidents – including the Kirk killing – to advance a narrative of an imminent left-wing domestic terror threat and to marshal federal agencies against it**. The memo’s opening sections list a litany of events (some real crimes, some lawful protests) and stitches them into a purported **“organized campaign” of left-wing violence threatening the nation** [brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition#:~:text=United%20HealthCare%20CEO%20Brian%20Thompson%3B,police%20and%20criminal%20justice%20protests). Notably, NSPM-7 claims these are _“not isolated incidents”_ but a coordinated conspiracy to _“silence opposing speech” and “prevent the functioning of society_.” Among the examples cherry-picked in the memo are the shooting of Charlie Kirk, attacks on conservative figures, and anti-ICE protests – **all attributed to a loose amalgam of leftist ideologies**. Meanwhile, **major instances of political violence by the far right (e.g. the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, a 2022 white-supremacist mass shooting in Buffalo) are conspicuously omitted from NSPM-7’s narrative**. This selective framing led the Brennan Center for Justice to flatly conclude: _“the list is obviously cherry-picked to highlight what the administration believes to be ‘left-wing’ violence and excludes other high-profile examples … that would puncture the narrative”_[brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition#:~:text=As%20a%20basic%20factual%20matter%2C,wing%20conspiracy). In short, NSPM-7 enshrines the **same attribution inversion the strategy of tension relied on**: focus on (and _inflate_) violence linked to left-wing actors, ignore violence from the right, and declare the former to be an orchestrated existential threat.\n\nMore chilling is how NSPM-7 then uses that skewed narrative to **justify sweeping action against a broad swath of ideas and associations.** The memorandum directs law enforcement and intelligence agencies to **prioritize investigations into a vague list of “extremist” categories** – categories that **explicitly include mainstream political beliefs and dissenting ideologies.** According to an analysis by the ACLU, _“If anyone needed proof that ‘terrorism’ and ‘political violence’ are slippery categories subject to political manipulation – this is it”_[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists#:~:text=liberties%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20almost%20a%20badge,of%20courage%20and%20honor)_._ Indeed, **NSPM-7’s text identifies “indicators” of domestic terrorism that are essentially viewpoints**. It flags, for example, _**“Anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity,” “extremism on migration, race, and gender,”**_ **and opposition to** _**“traditional American views on family, religion, and morality”**_ as warning signs of terrorist intent [aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20most%20chilling%20rhetorical,No%20wonder%20many%20in%20civil). These labels are so broad that they **encompass protected First Amendment expression – effectively casting dissent itself as suspect**. Under NSPM-7, someone protesting racism or advocating LGBTQ rights could, by virtue of _“extremism on race or gender,”_ be lumped into a terrorism watch list. Even _**“anti-capitalism”**_ sentiment – arguably a normal position on the political spectrum – is singled out as part of the supposed extremist matrix [aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20most%20chilling%20rhetorical,%E2%80%9Csupport%20for%20law%20enforcement%20and). The **conflation of ideology with criminality is deliberate**: as the Brennan Center notes, NSPM-7 portrays _“an imagined left-wing conspiracy”_ and authorizes punishment for _“even tenuous connections to speech the administration doesn’t like”_[brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition#:~:text=Purporting%20to%20go%20after%20%E2%80%9Cdomestic,speech%20the%20administration%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20like). It is the policy embodiment of the strategy of tension’s endgame: **use sporadic acts of violence (and a hefty dose of fear) to cast a wide net of suspicion over an entire political spectrum**, thereby **legitimizing expansive state surveillance and repression** of that spectrum.\n\nIt is important to stress that **NSPM-7 by itself does not create new criminal laws** – as a Presidential directive, it can’t override the Constitution. For instance, **there is (so far) no legal category of “domestic terrorism organization” in U.S. law** analogous to foreign terrorist designations. Attempts to designate loose movements like “Antifa” as terrorist groups have no statutory basis (and indeed Trump’s parallel _executive order_ calling for such designations was more symbolic than legal). However, the danger of NSPM-7 lies in its **“fever-dream” rhetoric and marching orders** to agencies. It instructs the DOJ, FBI, DHS, etc., to **use all available authorities to “disrupt” and “prevent” the memo’s imagined conspiracy** [aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists#:~:text=Through%20the%20memo%2C%20the%20president,%E2%80%9D). In practice this means intensifying surveillance, investigations, and information-sharing targeting activist groups, nonprofits, social movements, and individuals on the basis of ideology – something that has been happening under existing powers but now given an overt political mandate. The directive pointedly **fails to mention far-right violence (like the January 6 insurrection) at all** [brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition#:~:text=As%20a%20basic%20factual%20matter%2C,wing%20conspiracy), reinforcing that its focus is one-directional. Civil liberties experts warn that **the memo’s broad-brush approach will sweep in constitutionally protected speech and association**. In the words of one Congressman opposing NSPM-7, it _“dangerously conflates constitutionally protected speech with terrorism,”_ threatening First Amendment [aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists#:~:text=Civil%20society%20nonprofits%20and%20activists,badge%20of%20courage%20and%20honor).\n\nFrom a historical perspective, **NSPM-7 represents the culmination of a long “policy ratchet” that events like Charlie Kirk’s assassination have been used to turn**. Each shocking incident of real or purported left-wing violence becomes a **rationale to broaden the security state’s reach into political life**. For example, within hours of Kirk’s shooting – even before suspects were known – allied commentators were calling for harsher domestic terrorism statutes and crackdowns on leftist groups. The narrative _“conservatives are under violent siege from the Left”_ had political utility: it created a public mood receptive to aggressive measures. By the time NSPM-7 was unveiled weeks later, the White House explicitly cited _“recent attacks on public figures”_ as proof that a coordinated domestic extremist threat had to be crushed. In fact, **the memo asserts that all these acts of violence “have not emerged organically” but are the fruit of an organized campaign** [brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition#:~:text=ICE%20facility%3B%20and%20anti,criminal%20justice%20protests). This rhetoric mirrors the logic of Italy’s strategy of tension memos in the 1970s – except now coming from the highest office in the United States. It posits a **shadowy left-wing plot** and in response, **effectively green-lights a** _**state of exception**_ **with respect to dissent**: normal protections may be overridden because the nation faces an extraordinary domestic enemy.\n\n**Conclusion: From the Shadows to the Mainstream**\n\nLooking across these cases – from Cold War Italy’s secret terror schemes to the instant misinformation after the Kirk shooting – a clear throughline emerges. **The “strategy of tension” mindset, once hidden in the conspiratorial depths of spycraft, has seeped into overt politics.** Its core tenet is _attribution inversion_: when violence occurs, **blame the enemy within**. If no convenient enemy is present, _invent one_ or steer the narrative toward one. In Italy and Belgium, this was done covertly (planting bombs and framing leftists); in Sweden and Germany, it took the form of investigative bias (chasing phantom communists or mafia while ignoring real culprits). In today’s United States, the process is both more transparent and more rapid. The moment a bullet is fired or a bomb goes off, **social and political forces immediately shape the story to suit their ends**, often **contrary to initial evidence or lack thereof** [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-charlie-kirk-shot-assassination-3354b7ba0d736c198b454f77b3744308#:~:text=The%20reaction%20followed%20a%20well,erroneously%20reporting%20on%20Robinson%E2%80%99s%20background). This is abetted by modern media echo chambers that allow falsehoods to **“go viral” long before truth has its boots on**. The end result is the same sought by Cold War propagandists: **a fearful public, a demonized opposition, and a pretext for expanding state “security” powers** [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292475976_NATO's_secret_armies_Operation_GLADIO_and_terrorism_in_Western_Europe#:~:text=,also%20been%20members%20of%20a) [brennancenter.org](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/trumps-orders-targeting-antifascism-aim-criminalize-opposition#:~:text=Both%20the%20order%20and%20the,views%20with%20investigation%20and%20prosecution).\n\nWhat makes the current moment especially perilous is how _explicit_ and formalized this narrative has become. With NSPM-7, the United States government has essentially **adopted the rhetoric of the strategy of tension as official policy**– identifying broad left-wing ideologies as the prime domestic threat and directing agencies to treat them as such. It is a move that blurs the line between genuine security concerns and **political persecution**. Just as Italian democracy was nearly upended by false-flag terror blamed on “Communists,” America now flirts with equating **“extremism” with dissenting beliefs** [aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20most%20chilling%20rhetorical,No%20wonder%20many%20in%20civil). The historical record shows the cost of such distortions: **decades of truth suppressed, innocent people vilified or worse, and public trust corroded**.\n\nTo guard against history repeating, it’s essential to apply a **forensic, skeptical eye** when violent incidents occur. We must ask: _Who benefits from this narrative? What do we really know versus what is assumed?_ In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s murder, those questions were largely drowned out by the drumbeat of blame. Only later did the more complex reality emerge – and by then a policy train had left the station. Going forward, resisting the **“fast-twitch” blame game** may be critical to preserving democracy. Otherwise, we risk living permanently in what one Italian senator called _“a kind of double state – one open and democratic, the other clandestine and reactionary”_[phpisn.ethz.ch](https://phpisn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/synopsis76c1.html?navinfo=15301#:~:text=Furthermore%20this%20chapter%20relates%20how,one), where dark plots and reflexive fear drive us into the arms of demagogues promising order. The lesson of Operation Gladio and its successors is that **democracies can be manipulated into destroying the very freedoms they cherish, if they are first made afraid enough of an internal enemy**. Today’s narrative tactics, from online disinformation to directives like NSPM-7, show that those who would manipulate us have adapted with the times – and that _we the public must not be so easily led into the trap of the convenient culprit._\n\n**References:**\n\n_(Total 20 sources listed; all URLs accessed and verified Nov 2025.)_\n\n1.
